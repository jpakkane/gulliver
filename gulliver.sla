He sent me to Emanuel Col­lege in Cam­bridge, at four­teen years old, where I resided three years, and ap­plied my­self close to my stud­ies; but the charge of main­tain­ing me, al­though I had a very scanty al­lowance, be­ing too great for a nar­row for­tune, I was bound ap­pren­tice to Mr. James Bates, an em­i­nent sur­geon in Lon­don, with whom I con­tin­ued four years; and my fa­ther now and then send­ing me small sums of money, I laid them out in learn­ing nav­i­ga­tion, and other parts of the math­e­mat­ics, use­ful to those who in­tend to travel, as I al­ways be­lieved it would be, some time or other, my for­tune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my fa­ther; where, by the as­sis­tance of him and my un­cle John, and some other re­la­tions, I got forty pounds, and a prom­ise of thirty pounds a year to main­tain me at Ley­den; there I stud­ied physics two years and seven months, know­ing it would be use­ful in long voy­ages."/>

When I came back I re­solved to set­tle in Lon­don; to which Mr. Bates, my mas­ter, en­cour­aged me, and by him I was rec­om­mended to sev­eral pa­tients. I took part of a small house in the Old-Jury; and be­ing ad­vised to al­ter my con­di­tion, I mar­ried Mis­tress Mary Bur­ton, sec­ond daugh­ter to Mr. Ed­mund Bur­ton, hosier, in New­gate Street, with whom I re­ceived four hun­dred pounds for a por­tion."/>

                <ITEXT CH="But my good mas­ter Bates dy­ing two years af­ter, and I hav­ing few friends, my busi­ness be­gan to fail; for my con­science would not suf­fer me to im­i­tate the bad prac­tice of too many among my brethren. Hav­ing, there­fore, con­sulted with my wife and some of my ac­quain­tance, I de­ter­mined to go again to sea. I was sur­geon suc­ces­sively in two ships, and made sev­eral voy­ages, for six years, to the East and West In­dies, by which I got some ad­di­tion to my for­tune. My hours of leisure I spent in read­ing the best au­thors, an­cient and mod­ern, be­ing al­ways pro­vided with a good num­ber of books; and when I was ashore, in ob­serv­ing the man­ners and dis­po­si­tions of the peo­ple, as well as learn­ing their lan­guage, wherein I had a great fa­cil­ity, by the strength of my mem­ory."/>

Af­ter three years’ ex­pec­ta­tion that things would mend, I ac­cepted an ad­van­ta­geous of­fer from Cap­tain William Prichard, mas­ter of the An­te­lope, who was mak­ing a voy­age to the South Sea. We set sail from Bris­tol, May 4, 1699, and our voy­age at first was very pros­per­ous."/>

                <ITEXT CH="It would not be proper, for some rea­sons, to trou­ble the reader with the par­tic­u­lars of our ad­ven­tures in those seas; let it suf­fice to in­form him, that in our pas­sage from thence to the East In­dies, we were driven by a vi­o­lent storm to the north­west of Van Diemen’s Land. By an ob­ser­va­tion, we found our­selves in the lat­i­tude of 30 de­grees 2 min­utes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by im­mod­er­ate la­bor and ill food: the rest were in a very weak con­di­tion. On the 5th of No­vem­ber, which was the be­gin­ning of sum­mer in those parts, the weather be­ing very hazy, the sea­men spied a rock within half a ca­ble’s length of the ship, but the wind was so strong that we were driven di­rectly upon it, and im­me­di­ately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, hav­ing let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by my com­pu­ta­tion, about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, be­ing al­ready spent with la­bor while we were in the ship. We there­fore trusted our­selves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was over­set by a sud­den flurry from the north. What be­came of my com­pan­ions in the boat, as well as of those who es­caped on the rock, or were left in the ves­sel, I can­not tell, but con­clude they were all lost. For my own part, I swam as for­tune di­rected me, and was pushed for­ward by wind and tide. I of­ten let my legs drop, and could feel no bot­tom, but when I was al­most gone, and able to strug­gle no longer, I found my­self within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The de­cliv­ity was so small, that I walked near a mile be­fore I got to the shore, which I con­jec­tured was about eight o’clock in the evening. I then ad­vanced for­ward near half a mile, but could not dis­cover any sign of houses or in­hab­i­tants; at least I was in so weak a con­di­tion that I did not ob­serve them. I was ex­tremely tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found my­self much in­clined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I re­mem­ber to have done in my life, and, as I reck­oned, about nine hours; for when I awak­ened, it was just day­light. I at­tempted to rise, but was not able to stir; for, as I hap­pened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly fas­tened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same man­ner. I like­wise felt sev­eral slen­der lig­a­tures across my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only look up­wards; the sun be­gan to grow hot, and the light of­fended my eyes. I heard a con­fused noise about me; but in the pos­ture I lay, could see noth­ing ex­cept the sky. In a lit­tle time, I felt some­thing alive mov­ing on my left leg, which ad­vanc­ing gen­tly for­ward over my breast, came al­most up to my chin; when, bend­ing my eyes down­wards as much as I could, I per­ceived it to be a hu­man crea­ture not six inches high, with a bow and an ar­row in his hands and a quiver at his back. In the mean­time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I con­jec­tured) fol­low­ing the first. I was in the ut­most as­ton­ish­ment, and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright, and some of them, as I was af­ter­wards told, were hurt by the falls they got by leap­ing from my sides upon the ground. How­ever, they soon re­turned, and one of them who ven­tured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lift­ing up his hands and eyes by way of ad­mi­ra­tion, cried out in a shrill but dis­tinct voice, "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="Hek­inah degul!"/>
                <ITEXT CH=" The oth­ers re­peated the same words sev­eral times, but I then knew not what it meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may be­lieve, in great un­easi­ness; at length, strug­gling to get loose, I had the for­tune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that fas­tened my left arm to the ground, for, by lift­ing it up to my face, I dis­cov­ered the meth­ods they had taken to bind me, and at the same time with a vi­o­lent pull, which gave me ex­ces­sive pain, I a lit­tle loos­ened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the crea­tures ran off a sec­ond time, be­fore I could seize them; where­upon there was a great shout in a very shrill ac­cent, and af­ter it had ceased I heard one of them cry aloud, "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="Tolgo phonac;"/>
                <ITEXT CH=" when in an in­stant I felt above a hun­dred ar­rows dis­charged on my left hand, which pricked me like so many nee­dles; and be­sides they shot an­other flight into the air, as we do bombs in Eu­rope, whereof many, I sup­pose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and some on my face, which I im­me­di­ately cov­ered with my left hand. When this shower of ar­rows was over, I fell a-groan­ing with grief and pain, and then striv­ing again to get loose, they dis­charged an­other vol­ley larger than the first, and some of them at­tempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on me a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce. I thought it the most pru­dent method to lie still, and my de­sign was to con­tinue so till night, when, my left hand be­ing al­ready loose, I could eas­ily free my­self: and as for the in­hab­i­tants, I had rea­son to be­lieve I might be a match for the great­est army they could bring against me, if they were all of the same size with him that I saw. But for­tune dis­posed oth­er­wise of me. When the peo­ple ob­served I was quiet, they dis­charged no more ar­rows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their num­bers in­creased; and about four yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knock­ing for above an hour, like that of peo­ple at work; when turn­ing my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would per­mit me, I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the ground, ca­pa­ble of hold­ing four of the in­hab­i­tants, with two or three lad­ders to mount it: whence one of them, who seemed to be a per­son of qual­ity, made me a long speech, whereof I un­der­stood not a syl­la­ble. But I should have men­tioned, that be­fore the prin­ci­pal per­son be­gan his ora­tion, he cried out three times, "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="Lan­gro de­hul san"/>
                <ITEXT CH=" (these words and the for­mer were af­ter­wards re­peated and ex­plained to me). Where­upon, im­me­di­ately about fifty of the in­hab­i­tants came and cut the string that fas­tened the left side of my head, which gave me the lib­erty of turn­ing it to the right, and of ob­serv­ing the per­son and ges­ture of him that was to speak. He ap­peared to be of mid­dle age, and taller than any of the other three who at­tended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed to be some­what longer than my mid­dle fin­ger; the other two stood one on each side to sup­port him. He acted ev­ery part of an or­a­tor, and I could ob­serve many pe­ri­ods of threat­en­ings, and oth­ers of prom­ises, pity, and kind­ness. I an­swered in a few words, but in the most sub­mis­sive man­ner, lift­ing up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun, as call­ing him for a wit­ness; and be­ing al­most fam­ished with hunger, not hav­ing eaten a morsel for some hours be­fore I left the ship, I found the de­mands of na­ture so strong upon me that I could not for­bear show­ing my im­pa­tience (per­haps against the strict rules of de­cency), by putting my fin­ger fre­quently to my mouth, to sig­nify that I wanted food. The "/>

                <ITEXT CH=" (for so they call a great lord, as I af­ter­wards learned) un­der­stood me very well. He de­scended from the stage, and com­manded that sev­eral lad­ders should be ap­plied to my sides, on which about a hun­dred of the in­hab­i­tants mounted, and walked to­wards my mouth, laden with bas­kets full of meat, which had been pro­vided and sent thither by the king’s or­ders, upon the first in­tel­li­gence he re­ceived of me. I ob­served there was the flesh of sev­eral an­i­mals, but could not dis­tin­guish them by the taste. There were shoul­ders, legs and loins, shaped like those of mut­ton, and very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by two or three at a mouth­ful, and took three loaves at a time about the big­ness of mus­ket­balls. They sup­plied me as fast as they could, show­ing a thou­sand marks of won­der and as­ton­ish­ment at my bulk and ap­petite."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I then made an­other sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eat­ing that a small quan­tity would not suf­fice me; and be­ing a most in­ge­nious peo­ple, they slung up, with great dex­ter­ity, one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it to­wards my hand, and beat out the top; I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Bur­gundy, but much more de­li­cious. They brought me a sec­ond hogshead, which I drank in the same man­ner, and made signs for more: but they had none to give me. When I had per­formed these won­ders they shouted for joy, and danced upon my breast, re­peat­ing sev­eral times as they did at first, "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="Hek­inah degul"/>
                <ITEXT CH=". They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first warned the peo­ple be­low to stand out of the way, cry­ing aloud, "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="Bo­rach mevola:"/>
                <ITEXT CH=" and when they saw the ves­sels in the air there was a uni­ver­sal shout of "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="Hek­inah degul"/>
                <ITEXT CH=". I con­fess I was of­ten tempted, while they were pass­ing back­wards and for­wards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground. But the re­mem­brance of what I had felt, which prob­a­bly might not be the worst they could do, and the prom­ise of honor I made to them—for so I in­ter­preted my sub­mis­sive be­hav­ior—soon drove out these imag­i­na­tions. Be­sides, I now con­sid­ered my­self as bound by the laws of hos­pi­tal­ity to a peo­ple who had treated me with so much ex­pense and mag­nif­i­cence. How­ever, in my thoughts I could not suf­fi­ciently won­der at the in­tre­pid­ity of these diminu­tive mor­tals, who durst ven­ture to mount and walk upon my body while one of my hands was at lib­erty, with­out trem­bling at the very sight of so prodi­gious a crea­ture as I must ap­pear to them. Af­ter some time, when they ob­served that I made no more de­mands for meat, there ap­peared be­fore me a per­son of high rank from his im­pe­rial majesty. His ex­cel­lency, hav­ing mounted on the small of my right leg, ad­vanced for­wards up to my face, with about a dozen of his ret­inue, and pro­duc­ing his cre­den­tials un­der the signet royal, which he ap­plied close to my eyes, spoke about ten min­utes with­out any signs of anger, but with a kind of de­ter­mi­nate res­o­lu­tion: of­ten point­ing for­wards, which, as I af­ter­wards found, was to­wards the cap­i­tal city, about half a mile dis­tant, whither it was agreed by his majesty in coun­cil that I must be con­veyed. I an­swered in few words, but to no pur­pose, and made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his ex­cel­lency’s head for fear of hurt­ing him or his train), and then to my own head and body, to sig­nify that I de­sired my lib­erty. It ap­peared that he un­der­stood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of dis­ap­pro­ba­tion, and held his hands in a pos­ture to show that I must be car­ried as a pris­oner. How­ever, he made other signs, to let me un­der­stand that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treat­ment. Where­upon I once more thought of at­tempt­ing to break my bonds; but again, when I felt the smart of their ar­rows upon my face and hands, which were all in blis­ters, and many of the darts still stick­ing in them, and ob­serv­ing like­wise that the num­ber of my en­e­mies in­creased, I gave to­kens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased. Upon this the "/>

                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="pe­plom se­lan;"/>
                <ITEXT CH=" and I felt great num­bers of peo­ple on my left side re­lax­ing the cords to such a de­gree that I was able to turn upon my right. But, be­fore this, they had daubed my face and both my hands with a sort of oint­ment, very pleas­ant to the smell, which in a few min­utes re­moved all the smart of their ar­rows. These cir­cum­stances, added to the re­fresh­ment I had re­ceived by their vict­uals and drink, which were very nour­ish­ing, dis­posed me to sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was af­ter­wards as­sured; and it was no won­der, for the physi­cians, by the em­peror’s or­der, had min­gled a sleepy po­tion in the hogsheads of wine."/>

This prince has sev­eral ma­chines fixed on wheels for the car­riage of trees and other great weights. He of­ten builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine feet long, in the woods where the tim­ber grows, and has them car­ried on these en­gines three or four hun­dred yards to the sea. Five hun­dred car­pen­ters and en­gi­neers were im­me­di­ately set at work to pre­pare the great­est en­gine they had. It was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide, mov­ing upon twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the ar­rival of this en­gine, which, it seems, set out in four hours af­ter my land­ing. It was brought par­al­lel to me as I lay. But the prin­ci­pal dif­fi­culty was to raise and place me in this ve­hi­cle. Eighty poles, each one foot high, were erected for this pur­pose, and very strong cords, of the big­ness of pack­thread, were fas­tened by hooks to many ban­dages, which the work­men had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hun­dred of the strong­est men were em­ployed to draw up these cords by many pul­leys fas­tened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung into the en­gine, and there tied fast. All this I was told; for while the op­er­a­tion was per­form­ing I lay in a pro­found sleep, by the force of that so­porif­er­ous medicine in­fused into my liquor.

                <ITEXT CH="At the place where the car­riage stopped there stood an an­cient tem­ple, es­teemed to be the largest in the whole king­dom, which, hav­ing been pol­luted some years be­fore by an un­nat­u­ral mur­der, was, ac­cord­ing to the zeal of those peo­ple looked upon as pro­fane, and there­fore had been ap­plied to com­mon uses, and all the or­na­ments and fur­ni­ture car­ried away. In this ed­i­fice it was de­ter­mined I should lodge. The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet high and al­most two feet wide, through which I could eas­ily creep. On each side of the gate was a small win­dow, not above six inches from the ground; into that on the left side the king’s smiths con­veyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady’s watch in Eu­rope, and al­most as large, which were locked to my left leg with six-and-thirty pad­locks. Over against this tem­ple, on the other side of the great high­way, at twenty feet dis­tance, there was a tur­ret at least five feet high. Here the em­peror as­cended, with many prin­ci­pal lords of his court, to have an op­por­tu­nity of view­ing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It was reck­oned that above a hun­dred thou­sand in­hab­i­tants came out of the town upon the same er­rand; and, in spite of my guards, I be­lieve there could not be fewer than ten thou­sand, at sev­eral times, who mounted my body, by the help of lad­ders. But a procla­ma­tion was soon is­sued to for­bid it upon pain of death. When the work­men found it was im­pos­si­ble for me to break loose they cut all the strings that bound me; where­upon I rose up, with as melan­choly a dis­po­si­tion as ever I had in my life. But the noise and as­ton­ish­ment of the peo­ple at see­ing me rise and walk are not to be ex­pressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not only the lib­erty of walk­ing back­wards and for­wards in a semi­cir­cle, but be­ing fixed within four inches of the gate, al­lowed me to creep in and lie at my full length in the tem­ple."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The em­peror was al­ready de­scended from the tower and ad­vanc­ing on horse­back to­wards me, which had like to have cost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly un­used to such a sight, which ap­peared as if a moun­tain moved be­fore him, reared up on his hind­feet; but that prince, who is an ex­cel­lent horse­man, kept his seat, till his at­ten­dants ran in and held the bri­dle, while his majesty had time to dis­mount. When he alighted he sur­veyed me round with great ad­mi­ra­tion; but kept with­out the length of my chain. He or­dered his cooks and but­lers, who were al­ready pre­pared, to give me vict­uals and drink, which they pushed for­ward in a sort of ve­hi­cles upon wheels till I could reach them, I took these ve­hi­cles and soon emp­tied them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the for­mer af­forded me two or three good mouth­fuls; and I emp­tied the liquor of ten ves­sels, which was con­tained in earthen vials, into one ve­hi­cle, drink­ing it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest. The em­press and young princes of the blood of both sexes, at­tended by many ladies, sat at some dis­tance in their chairs; but, upon the ac­ci­dent that hap­pened to the em­peror’s horse, they alighted, and came near his per­son, which I am now go­ing to de­scribe. He is taller by al­most the breadth of my nail, than any of his court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into the be­hold­ers. His fea­tures are strong and mas­cu­line, with an Aus­trian lip and arched nose, his com­plex­ion olive, his coun­te­nance erect, his body and limbs well pro­por­tioned, all his mo­tions grace­ful and his de­port­ment ma­jes­tic. He was then past his prime, be­ing twenty-eight years and three-quar­ters old, of which he had reigned about seven in great fe­lic­ity and gen­er­ally vic­to­ri­ous. For the bet­ter con­ve­nience of be­hold­ing him I lay on my side, so that my face was par­al­lel to his, and he stood but three yards off; how­ever, I have had him since many times in my hand, and there­fore can­not be de­ceived in the de­scrip­tion. His dress was very plain and sim­ple, and the fash­ion of it be­tween the Asi­atic and the Eu­ro­pean; but he had on his head a light hel­met of gold, adorned with jew­els, and a plume on the crest. He held his sword drawn in his hand to de­fend him­self, if I should hap­pen to break loose: it was al­most three inches long; the hilt and scab­bard were gold en­riched with di­a­monds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and ar­tic­u­late, and I could dis­tinctly hear it when I stood up. The ladies and courtiers were all most mag­nif­i­cently clad, so that the spot they stood upon seemed to re­sem­ble a pet­ti­coat spread on the ground, em­broi­dered with fig­ures of gold and sil­ver. His im­pe­rial majesty spoke of­ten to me, and I re­turned an­swers, but nei­ther of us could un­der­stand a syl­la­ble. There were sev­eral of his priests and lawyers present (as I con­jec­tured by their habits), who were com­manded to ad­dress them­selves to me, and I spoke to them in as many lan­guages as I had the least smat­ter­ing of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Span­ish, Ital­ian, and Lin­gua Franca; but all to no pur­pose. Af­ter about two hours the court re­tired, and I was left with a strong guard to pre­vent the im­per­ti­nence, and prob­a­bly the mal­ice of the rab­ble, who were very im­pa­tient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had the im­pu­dence to shoot their ar­rows at me as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof one very nar­rowly missed my left eye. But the colonel or­dered six of the ring­leaders to be seized, and thought no pun­ish­ment so proper as to de­liver them bound into my hands; which some of his sol­diers ac­cord­ingly did, push­ing them for­wards with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach. I took them all in my right hand, put five of them into my coat pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a coun­te­nance as if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled ter­ri­bly, and the colonel and his of­fi­cers were in much pain, es­pe­cially when they saw me take out my penknife; but I soon put them out of fear; for, look­ing mildly, and im­me­di­ately cut­ting the strings he was bound with, I set him gen­tly on the ground and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same man­ner, tak­ing them one by one out of my pocket; and I ob­served both the sol­diers and peo­ple were highly obliged at this mark of my clemency, which was rep­re­sented very much to my ad­van­tage at court."/>

Some­times they de­ter­mined to starve me, or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poi­soned ar­rows which would soon dis­patch me; but again they con­sid­ered that the stench of so large a car­cass might pro­duce a plague in the me­trop­o­lis and prob­a­bly spread through the whole king­dom. In the midst of these con­sul­ta­tions sev­eral of­fi­cers of the army went to the door of the great coun­cil cham­ber and two of them be­ing ad­mit­ted, gave an ac­count of my be­hav­ior to the six crim­i­nals above men­tioned; which made so fa­vor­able an im­pres­sion in the breast of his majesty and the whole board in my be­half that an im­pe­rial com­mis­sion was is­sued out, oblig­ing all the vil­lages nine hun­dred yards round the city, to de­liver in ev­ery morn­ing six beeves, forty sheep, and other vict­uals for my sus­te­nance; to­gether with a pro­por­tion­able quan­tity of bread, and wine and other liquors; for the due pay­ment of which his majesty gave as­sign­ments upon his trea­sury. For this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes, sel­dom ex­cept upon great oc­ca­sions rais­ing any sub­si­dies upon his sub­jects, who are bound to at­tend him in his wars at their own ex­pense. An es­tab­lish­ment was also made of six hun­dred per­sons to be my do­mes­tics, who had board-wages al­lowed for their main­te­nance and tents built for them very con­ve­niently on each side of my door. It was like­wise or­dered that three hun­dred tai­lors should make me a suit of clothes af­ter the fash­ion of the coun­try; that six of his majesty’s great­est schol­ars should be em­ployed to in­struct me in their lan­guage; and, lastly, that the em­peror’s horses, and those of the no­bil­ity and troops of guards, should be fre­quently ex­er­cised in my sight, to ac­cus­tom them­selves to me. All these or­ders were duly put in ex­e­cu­tion, and in about three weeks I made a great progress in learn­ing their lan­guage; dur­ing which time the em­peror fre­quently hon­ored me with his vis­its, and was pleased to as­sist my mas­ters in teach­ing me. We be­gan al­ready to con­verse to­gether in some sort; and the first words I learned were to ex­press my de­sire that he would please to give me my lib­erty; which I ev­ery day re­peated on my knees. His an­swer, as I could ap­pre­hend it, was that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on with­out the ad­vice of his coun­cil, and that first I must "/>

He de­sired I would not take it ill if he gave or­ders to cer­tain proper of­fi­cers to search me; for prob­a­bly I might carry about me sev­eral weapons, which must needs be dan­ger­ous things, if they an­swered the bulk of so prodi­gious a per­son. I said his majesty should be sat­is­fied, for I was ready to strip my­self and turn up my pock­ets be­fore him. This I de­liv­ered part in words and part in signs. He replied that, by the laws of the king­dom I must be searched by two of his of­fi­cers; that he knew this could not be done with­out my con­sent and as­sis­tance; that he had so good an opin­ion of my gen­eros­ity and jus­tice as to trust their per­sons in my hands; that what­ever they took from me should be re­turned when I left the coun­try or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them. I took up the two of­fi­cers in my hands, put them first into my coat pock­ets and then into ev­ery other pocket about me, ex­cept my two fobs, and an­other se­cret pocket which I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some lit­tle nec­es­saries that were of no con­se­quence to any but my­self. In one of my fobs there was a sil­ver watch and in the other a small quan­tity of gold in a purse. These gen­tle­men, hav­ing pen, ink, and pa­per about them, made an ex­act in­ven­tory of ev­ery­thing they saw; and when they had done, de­sired I would set them down, that they might de­liver it to the em­peror.

                <ITEXT CH="), af­ter the strictest search, we found only one great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge sil­ver chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we the searchers were not able to lift. We de­sired it should be opened, and one of us step­ping into it, found him­self up to the mid-leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof fly­ing up to our faces, set us both a-sneez­ing sev­eral times to­gether. In his right waist­coat pocket we found a prodi­gious bun­dle of white thin sub­stances, folded one over an­other, about the big­ness of three men, tied with a strong ca­ble and marked with black fig­ures; which we humbly con­ceive to be writ­ings, ev­ery let­ter al­most half as large as the palm of our hands. In the left there was a sort of en­gine, from the back of which were ex­tended twenty long poles, re­sem­bling the pal­isa­does be­fore your majesty’s court; where­with we con­jec­ture the Man-moun­tain combs his head, for we did not al­ways trou­ble him with ques­tions, be­cause we found it a great dif­fi­culty to make him un­der­stand us. In the large pocket on the right side of his mid­dle cover (so I trans­late "/>
                <ITEXT FONT="Nimbus Roman Italic" CH="ranfu-lo"/>
                <ITEXT CH=", by which they meant my breeches), we saw a hol­low pil­lar of iron, about the length of a man, fas­tened to a strong piece of tim­ber larger than the pil­lar, and upon one side of the pil­lar were huge pieces of iron stick­ing out, cut into strange fig­ures, which we know not what to make of. In the left pocket an­other en­gine of the same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were sev­eral round flat pieces of white and red metal, of dif­fer­ent bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be sil­ver, were so large and heavy that my com­rade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pil­lars ir­reg­u­larly shaped; we could not, with­out dif­fi­culty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bot­tom of his pocket. One of them was cov­ered and seemed all of a piece; but at the up­per end of the other there ap­peared a white round sub­stance, about twice the big­ness of our heads. Within each of these was in­closed a prodi­gious plate of steel; which, by our or­ders, we obliged him to show us, be­cause we ap­pre­hended they might be dan­ger­ous en­gines. He took them out of their cases, and told us that in his own coun­try his prac­tice was to shave his beard with one of these and to cut his meat with the other. There were two pock­ets which we could not en­ter; these he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his mid­dle cover, but squeezed close by the pres­sure of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great sil­ver chain, with a won­der­ful kind of en­gine at the bot­tom. We di­rected him to draw out what­ever was fas­tened to that chain, which ap­peared to be a globe, half sil­ver, and half of some trans­par­ent metal; for on the trans­par­ent side we saw cer­tain strange fig­ures cir­cu­larly drawn, and thought we could touch them till we found our fin­gers stopped by that lu­cid sub­stance. He put his en­gine to our ears, which made an in­ces­sant noise, like that of a wa­ter­mill; and we con­jec­ture it is ei­ther some un­known an­i­mal or the god that he wor­ships; but we are more in­clined to the lat­ter opin­ion, be­cause he as­sures us (if we un­der­stood him right, for he ex­pressed him­self very im­per­fectly) that he sel­dom did any­thing with­out con­sult­ing it. He called it his or­a­cle, and said it pointed out the time for ev­ery ac­tion of his life. From the left fob he took out a net al­most large enough for a fish­er­man, but con­trived to open and shut like a purse, and which served him for the same use; we found therein sev­eral massy pieces of yel­low metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of im­mense value."/>

He first called for my scim­i­tar, which I took out, scab­bard and all. In the mean­time he or­dered three thou­sand of his choic­est troops (who then at­tended him) to sur­round me at a dis­tance, with their bows and ar­rows just ready to dis­charge; but I did not ob­serve it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his majesty. He then de­sired me to draw my scim­i­tar, which, al­though it had got some rust by the sea wa­ter, was in most parts ex­ceed­ing bright. I did so, and im­me­di­ately all the troops gave a shout be­tween ter­ror and sur­prise; for the sun shone clear, and the re­flec­tion daz­zled their eyes as I waved the scim­i­tar to and fro in my hand. His majesty, who is a most mag­nan­i­mous prince, was less daunted than I could ex­pect; he or­dered me to re­turn it into the scab­bard and cast it on the ground as gen­tly as I could, about six feet from the end of my chain. The next thing he de­manded was one of the hol­low iron  pil­lars, by which he meant my pocket pis­tols. I drew it out, and at his de­sire, as well as I could, ex­pressed to him the use of it; and charg­ing it only with pow­der, which by the close­ness of my pouch hap­pened to es­cape wet­ting in the sea (an in­con­ve­nience against which all pru­dent mariners take spe­cial care to pro­vide), I first cau­tioned the em­peror not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The as­ton­ish­ment here was much greater than at the sight of the scim­i­tar. Hun­dreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the em­peror, al­though he stood his ground, could not re­cover him­self in some time. I de­liv­ered up both my pis­tols in the same man­ner as I had done my scim­i­tar, and then my pouch of pow­der and bul­lets; beg­ging him that the for­mer might be kept from the fire, for it would kin­dle with the small­est spark and blow up his im­pe­rial palace into the air. I like­wise de­liv­ered up my watch, which the em­peror was very cu­ri­ous to see, and com­manded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoul­ders, as dray­men in Eng­land do a bar­rel of ale. He was amazed at the con­tin­ual noise it made, and the mo­tion of the minute hand, which he could eas­ily dis­cern; for their sight is much more acute than ours; and asked the opin­ions of his learned men about him, which were var­i­ous and re­mote, as the reader may imag­ine with­out my re­peat­ing; al­though, in­deed, I could not very per­fectly un­der­stand them. I then gave up my sil­ver and cop­per money, my purse with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and ra­zor, my comb and sil­ver snuff box, my hand­ker­chief and jour­nal book. My scim­i­tar, pis­tols, and pouch were con­veyed in car­riages to his majesty’s stores, but the rest of my goods were re­turned me."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The horses of the army, and those of the royal sta­bles, hav­ing been daily led be­fore me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet with­out start­ing. The rid­ers would leap them over my hand, as I held it on the ground; and one of the em­peror’s hunts­men, upon a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all, which was in­deed a prodi­gious leap. I had the good for­tune to di­vert the em­peror one day af­ter a very ex­tra­or­di­nary man­ner. I de­sired he would or­der sev­eral sticks of two feet high, and the thick­ness of an or­di­nary cane, to be brought me; where­upon his majesty com­manded the mas­ter of his woods to give di­rec­tions ac­cord­ingly, and the next morn­ing six wood­men ar­rived with as many car­riages, drawn by eight horses to each. I took nine of these sticks and fix­ing them firmly in the ground in a quad­ran­gu­lar fig­ure, two feet and a half square, I took four other sticks and tied them par­al­lel at each cor­ner, about two feet from the ground; then I fas­tened my hand­ker­chief to the nine sticks that stood erect, and ex­tended it on all sides, till it was tight as the top of a drum; and the four par­al­lel sticks, ris­ing about five inches higher than the hand­ker­chief, served as ledges on each side. When I had fin­ished my work I de­sired the em­peror to let a troop of his best horse, twenty-four in num­ber, come and ex­er­cise upon this plane. His majesty ap­proved of the pro­posal, and I took them up one by one in my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper of­fi­cers to ex­er­cise them. As soon as they got into or­der they di­vided into two par­ties, per­formed mock skir­mishes, dis­charged blunt ar­rows, drew their swords, fled and pur­sued, at­tacked and re­tired, and in short, dis­cov­ered the best mil­i­tary dis­ci­pline I ever be­held. The par­al­lel sticks se­cured them and their horses from fall­ing over the stage; and the em­peror was so much de­lighted that he or­dered this en­ter­tain­ment to be re­peated sev­eral days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of com­mand; and, with great dif­fi­culty, per­suaded even the em­press her­self to let me hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, from whence she was able to take a full view of the whole per­for­mance. It was my good for­tune that no ill ac­ci­dent hap­pened in these en­ter­tain­ments; only once a fiery horse that be­longed to one of the cap­tains, paw­ing with his hoof, struck a hole in my hand­ker­chief, and, his foot slip­ping, he over­threw his rider and him­self; but I im­me­di­ately re­lieved them both, and, cov­er­ing the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other, in the same man­ner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in the left shoul­der, but the rider got no hurt, and I re­paired my hand­ker­chief as well as I could; how­ever, I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dan­ger­ous en­ter­prises."/>

                <ITEXT CH="About two or three days be­fore I was set at lib­erty, as I was en­ter­tain­ing the court with this kind of feats, there ar­rived an ex­press to in­form his majesty that some of his sub­jects, rid­ing near the place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black sub­stance ly­ing on the ground, very oddly shaped, ex­tend­ing its edges round as wide as his majesty’s bed­cham­ber, and ris­ing up in the mid­dle as high as a man; that it was no liv­ing crea­ture, as they at first ap­pre­hended, for it lay on the grass with­out mo­tion, and some of them had walked round it sev­eral times; that, by mount­ing upon each other’s shoul­ders, they had got to the top, which was flat and even, and stamp­ing upon it, they found that it was hol­low within; that they humbly con­ceived it might be some­thing be­long­ing to the Man-moun­tain; and if his majesty pleased they would un­der­take to bring it with only five horses. I presently knew what they meant, and was glad at heart to re­ceive this in­tel­li­gence. It seems, upon my first reach­ing the shore af­ter our ship­wreck, I was in such con­fu­sion that be­fore I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fas­tened with a string to my head while I was row­ing, and had stuck on all the time I was swim­ming, fell off af­ter I came to land; the string, as I con­jec­ture, break­ing by some ac­ci­dent which I never ob­served, but thought my hat had been lost at sea. I en­treated his im­pe­rial majesty to give or­ders it might be brought to me as soon as pos­si­ble, de­scrib­ing to him the use and the na­ture of it; and the next day the wag­oners ar­rived with it, but not in a very good con­di­tion; they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a half of the edge, and fas­tened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to the har­ness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an Eng­lish mile, but the ground in that coun­try be­ing ex­tremely smooth and level, it re­ceived less dam­age than I ex­pected."/>

The peo­ple had no­tice, by procla­ma­tion, of my de­sign to visit the town. The wall which en­com­passed it, is two feet and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong tow­ers at ten feet dis­tance. I stepped over the great west­ern gate, and passed very gen­tly and sidel­ing through the two prin­ci­pal streets, only in my short waist­coat, for fear of dam­ag­ing the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat. I walked with the ut­most cir­cum­spec­tion, to avoid tread­ing on any strag­glers that might re­main in the streets; al­though the or­ders were very strict that all peo­ple should keep in their houses, at their own peril. The gar­ret win­dows and tops of houses were so crowded with spec­ta­tors that I thought in all my trav­els I had not seen a more pop­u­lous place. The city is an ex­act square, each side of the wall be­ing five hun­dred feet long. The two great streets which run across and di­vide it into four quar­ters, are five feet wide. The lanes and al­leys, which I could not en­ter, but only viewed them as I passed, are from twelve to eigh­teen inches. The town is ca­pa­ble of hold­ing five hun­dred thou­sand souls. The houses are from three to five sto­ries; the shops and mar­kets well pro­vided."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The em­peror’s palace is in the cen­ter of the city, where the two great streets meet. It is in­closed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet dis­tant from the build­ings. I had his majesty’s per­mis­sion to step over this wall; and the space be­ing so wide be­tween that and the palace, I could eas­ily view it on ev­ery side. The out­ward court is a square of forty feet, and in­cludes two other courts; in the in­most are the royal apart­ments, which I was very de­sirous to see, but found it ex­tremely dif­fi­cult; for the great gates, from one square into an­other, were but eigh­teen inches high and seven inches wide. Now the build­ings of the outer court were at least five feet high, and it was im­pos­si­ble for me to stride over them with­out in­fi­nite dam­age to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the same time the em­peror had a great de­sire that I should see the mag­nif­i­cence of his palace; but this I was not able to do till three days af­ter, which I spent in cut­ting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hun­dred yards’ dis­tance from the city. Of these trees I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my weight. The peo­ple hav­ing re­ceived no­tice a sec­ond time, I went again through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands. When I came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool and took the other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gen­tly set it down on the space be­tween the first and sec­ond court, which was eight feet wide. I then stepped over the build­ings very con­ve­niently from one stool to the other, and drew up the first one af­ter me with a hooked stick. By this con­trivance I got into the in­most court; and, ly­ing down upon my side, I ap­plied my face to the win­dows of the mid­dle sto­ries, which were left open on pur­pose, and dis­cov­ered the most splen­did apart­ments that can be imag­ined."/>

We ap­pre­hend his im­pe­rial high­ness, the heir to the crown, to have some ten­dency to­wards the High-heels; at least, we can plainly dis­cover one of his heels higher than the other, which gives him a hob­ble in his gait. Now, in the midst of these in­tes­tine dis­qui­ets, we are threat­ened with an in­va­sion from the is­land of Ble­fuscu, which is the other great em­pire of the uni­verse, al­most as large and pow­er­ful as this of his majesty. For as to what we have heard you af­firm, that there are other king­doms and states in the world, in­hab­ited by hu­man crea­tures as large as your­self, our philoso­phers are in much doubt, and would rather con­jec­ture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars; be­cause it is cer­tain that a hun­dred mor­tals of your bulk would in a short time de­stroy all the fruits and cat­tle of his majesty’s do­min­ions; be­sides, our his­to­ries of six thou­sand moons make no men­tion of any other re­gions than the two great em­pires of Lil­liput and Ble­fuscu. Which two mighty pow­ers have, as I was go­ing to tell you, been en­gaged in a most ob­sti­nate war for six-and-thirty moons past. It be­gan upon the fol­low­ing oc­ca­sion: It is al­lowed on all hands, that the prim­i­tive way of break­ing eggs, be­fore we eat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty’s grand­fa­ther, while he was a boy, go­ing to eat an egg, and break­ing it ac­cord­ing to the an­cient prac­tice, hap­pened to cut one of his fin­gers; where­upon the em­peror, his fa­ther, pub­lished an edict, com­mand­ing all his sub­jects, upon great penal­ties, to break the smaller end of their eggs. The peo­ple so highly re­sented this law, that our his­to­ries tell us there have been six re­bel­lions raised on that ac­count; wherein one em­peror lost his life, and an­other his crown. These civil com­mo­tions were con­stantly fo­mented by the mon­archs of Ble­fuscu; and when they were quelled, the ex­iles al­ways fled for refuge to that em­pire. It is com­puted that eleven thou­sand per­sons have, at sev­eral times, suf­fered death, rather than sub­mit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many hun­dred large vol­umes have been pub­lished upon this con­tro­versy; but the books of the Big-en­di­ans have been long for­bid­den, and the whole party ren­dered in­ca­pable by law of hold­ing em­ploy­ments. Dur­ing the course of these trou­bles, the em­per­ors of Ble­fuscu did fre­quently ex­pos­tu­late by their am­bas­sadors, ac­cus­ing us of mak­ing a schism in re­li­gion by of­fend­ing against a fun­da­men­tal doc­trine of our great prophet Lus­trog, in the fifty-fourth chap­ter of the Blun­de­cral, which is their Al­co­ran. This, how­ever, is thought to be a mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: That all true be­liev­ers shall break their eggs at the con­ve­nient end; and which is the con­ve­nient end seems, in my hum­ble opin­ion, to be left to ev­ery man’s con­science, or at least in the power of the chief mag­is­trate to de­ter­mine. Now, the Big-en­dian ex­iles have found so much credit in the em­peror of Ble­fuscu’s court, and so much pri­vate as­sis­tance and en­cour­age­ment from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been car­ried on be­tween the two em­pires for six-and-thirty moons, with var­i­ous suc­cess; dur­ing which time we have lost forty cap­i­tal ships, and a much greater num­ber of smaller ves­sels, to­gether with thirty thou­sand of our best sea­men and sol­diers; and the dam­age re­ceived by the en­emy is reck­oned to be some­what greater than ours. How­ever, they have now equipped a nu­mer­ous fleet, and are just pre­par­ing to make a de­scent upon us; and his im­pe­rial majesty, plac­ing great con­fi­dence in your valor and strength, has com­manded me to lay this ac­count of his af­fairs be­fore you.”"/>

I walked to­wards the north­east coast, over against Ble­fuscu, and ly­ing down be­hind a hillock, I took out my small pocket per­spec­tive glass, and viewed the en­emy’s fleet at an­chor, con­sist­ing of about fifty men of war, and a great num­ber of trans­ports; I then came back to my house, and gave or­ders (for which I had a war­rant) for a great quan­tity of the strong­est ca­ble and bars of iron. The ca­ble was about as thick as pack­thread, and the bars of the length and size of a knit­ting nee­dle. I tre­bled the ca­ble to make it stronger, and for the same rea­son I twisted three of the iron bars to­gether, bend­ing the ex­trem­i­ties into a hook. Hav­ing thus fixed fifty hooks to as many ca­bles, I went back to the north­east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stock­ings, walked into the sea in my leath­ern jerkin, about half an hour be­fore high wa­ter. I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the mid­dle about thirty yards, till I felt ground. I ar­rived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The en­emy were so fright­ened when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thou­sand souls. I then took my tack­ling, and fas­ten­ing a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords to­gether at the end. While I was thus em­ployed, the en­emy dis­charged sev­eral thou­sand ar­rows, many of which stuck in my hands and face; and be­sides the ex­ces­sive smart, gave me much dis­tur­bance in my work. My great­est ap­pre­hen­sion was for my eyes, which I should have in­fal­li­bly lost, if I had not sud­denly thought of an ex­pe­di­ent. I kept, among other lit­tle nec­es­saries, a pair of spec­ta­cles in a pri­vate pocket, which, as I ob­served be­fore, had es­caped the em­peror’s searchers. These I took out and fas­tened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and, thus armed, went on boldly with my work, in spite of the en­emy’s ar­rows, many of which struck against the glasses of my spec­ta­cles, but with­out any other ef­fect fur­ther than a lit­tle to dis­com­pose them. I had now fas­tened all the hooks, and tak­ing the knot in my hand, be­gan to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their an­chors, so that the bold­est part of my en­ter­prise re­mained. I there­fore let go the cord, and leav­ing the hooks fixed to the ships, I res­o­lutely cut with my knife the ca­bles that fas­tened the an­chors, re­ceiv­ing about two hun­dred ar­rows in my face and hands; then I took up the knot­ted end of the ca­bles to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the en­emy’s largest men of war af­ter me."/>

Hav­ing a head me­chan­i­cally turned, and be­ing like­wise forced by ne­ces­sity, I had made for my­self a ta­ble and chair con­ve­nient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park.

Their linen is usu­ally three inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The seam­stresses took my mea­sure as I lay on the ground, one stand­ing at my neck, and an­other at my mid-leg, with a strong cord ex­tended, that each held by the end, while a third mea­sured the length of the cord with a rule an inch long. Then they mea­sured my right thumb, and de­sired no more; for by a math­e­mat­i­cal com­pu­ta­tion, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I dis­played on the ground be­fore them for a pat­tern, they fit­ted me ex­actly. Three hun­dred tai­lors were em­ployed in the same man­ner to make me clothes; but they had an­other con­trivance for tak­ing my mea­sure. I kneeled down, and they raised a lad­der from the ground to my neck; upon this lad­der one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb line from my col­lar to the floor, which just an­swered the length of my coat; but my waist and arms I mea­sured my­self. When my clothes were fin­ished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them) they looked like the patch­work made by the ladies in Eng­land, only that mine were all of a color."/>

I pulled off my shoes and stock­ings, and wad­ing two or three hun­dred yards, I found the ob­ject to ap­proach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I sup­posed might by some tem­pest have been driven from a ship; where­upon I re­turned im­me­di­ately to­wards the city, and de­sired his im­pe­rial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest ves­sels he had left af­ter the loss of his fleet, and three thou­sand sea­men, un­der the com­mand of his vice-ad­mi­ral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back the short­est way to the coast where I first dis­cov­ered the boat. I found the tide had driven it still nearer. The sea­men were all pro­vided with cordage, which I had be­fore­hand twisted to a suf­fi­cient strength. When the ships came up, I stripped my­self, and waded till I came within a hun­dred yards of the boat, af­ter which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The sea­men threw me the end of the cord, which I fas­tened to a hole in the fore part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found all my la­bor to lit­tle pur­pose; for, be­ing out of my depth, I was not able to work. In this ne­ces­sity I was forced to swim be­hind, and push the boat for­ward as of­ten as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide fa­vor­ing me, I ad­vanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three min­utes, and then gave the boat an­other shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and now the most la­bo­ri­ous part be­ing over, I took out my other ca­bles, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fas­ten­ing them first to the boat, and then to nine of the ves­sels which at­tended me; the wind be­ing fa­vor­able, the sea­men towed, and I shoved, un­til we ar­rived within forty yards of the shore, and wait­ing till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by the as­sis­tance of two thou­sand men with ropes and en­gines, I made a shift to turn it on its bot­tom, and found it was but lit­tle dam­aged."/>

I told the em­peror that my good for­tune had thrown this boat in my way, to carry me to some place whence I might re­turn into my na­tive coun­try; and begged his majesty’s or­ders for get­ting ma­te­ri­als to fit it up, to­gether with his li­cense to de­part; which, af­ter some kind ex­pos­tu­la­tions, he was pleased to grant."/>

This en­voy had in­struc­tions to rep­re­sent to the monarch of Ble­fuscu, the great lenity of his mas­ter, who was con­tent to pun­ish me no fur­ther than with the loss of my eyes; that I had fled from jus­tice, and if I did not re­turn in two hours, I should be de­prived of my ti­tle of nar­dac and de­clared a traitor. The en­voy fur­ther added, that in or­der to main­tain the peace and amity be­tween both em­pires, his mas­ter ex­pected that his brother of Ble­fuscu would give or­ders to have me sent back to Lil­liput, bound hand and foot, to be pun­ished as a traitor."/>

I would gladly have taken a dozen of the na­tives, but this was a thing the em­peror would by no means per­mit; and be­sides a dili­gent search into my pock­ets, his majesty en­gaged my honor not to carry away any of his sub­jects, al­though with their own con­sent and de­sire."/>

I ad­vanced for­ward, and cast an­chor on the lee side of the is­land, which seemed to be un­in­hab­ited. I then took some re­fresh­ment and went to my rest. I slept well, and I con­jec­ture at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours af­ter I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my break­fast be­fore the sun was up, and heav­ing an­chor, the wind be­ing fa­vor­able, I steered the same course that I had done the day be­fore, wherein I was di­rected by my pocket com­pass. My in­ten­tion was to reach, if pos­si­ble, one of those is­lands which I had rea­son to be­lieve lay to the north­east of Van Diemen’s Land. I dis­cov­ered noth­ing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the af­ter­noon, when I had by my com­pu­ta­tion made twenty-four leagues from Ble­fuscu, I de­scried a sail steer­ing to the south­east; my course was due east. I hailed her, but could get no an­swer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slack­ened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then hung out her an­cient, and dis­charged a gun. It is not easy to ex­press the joy I was in, upon the un­ex­pected hope of once more see­ing my beloved coun­try and the dear pledges I had left in it. The ship slack­ened her sails, and I came up with her be­tween five and six in the evening, Sep­tem­ber twenty-sixth; but my heart leaped within me to see her Eng­lish col­ors. I put my cows and sheep into my coat pock­ets and got on board with all my lit­tle cargo of pro­vi­sions. The ves­sel was an Eng­lish mer­chant­man re­turn­ing from Japan by the North and South seas; the cap­tain, Mr. John Bid­del of Dept­ford, a very civil man and an ex­cel­lent sailor. We were now in the lat­i­tude of 30 de­grees south. There were about fifty men in the ship; and here I met an old com­rade of mine, one Pe­ter Williams, who gave me a good char­ac­ter to the cap­tain. This gen­tle­man treated me with kind­ness and de­sired I would let him know what place I came from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in few words, but he thought I was rav­ing, and that the dan­gers I un­der­went had dis­turbed my head; where­upon I took my black cat­tle and sheep out of my pocket, which, af­ter great as­ton­ish­ment, clearly con­vinced him of my ve­rac­ity. I then showed him the gold given me by the em­peror of Ble­fuscu, to­gether with his majesty’s pic­ture at full length, and some other rar­i­ties of that coun­try. I gave him two purses of two hun­dred "/>

                <ITEXT CH="I shall not trou­ble the reader with a par­tic­u­lar ac­count of this voy­age, which was very pros­per­ous for the most part. We ar­rived in the Downs on the 13th of April, 1702. I had only one mis­for­tune, that the rats on board car­ried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked clean from the flesh. The rest of my cat­tle I got safe on shore, and set them a-graz­ing on a bowl­ing green at Green­wich, where the fine­ness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had al­ways feared the con­trary: nei­ther could I pos­si­bly have pre­served them in so long a voy­age if the cap­tain had not al­lowed me some of his best bis­cuit, which, rubbed to pow­der and min­gled with wa­ter, was their con­stant food. The short time I con­tin­ued in Eng­land I made a con­sid­er­able profit by show­ing my cat­tle to many per­sons of qual­ity and oth­ers; and be­fore I be­gan my sec­ond voy­age I sold them for six hun­dred pounds. Since my last re­turn I find the breed is con­sid­er­ably in­creased, es­pe­cially the sheep; which I hope will prove much to the ad­van­tage of the woolen man­u­fac­ture, by the fine­ness of the fleeces."/>

My el­dest un­cle, John, had left me an es­tate in land near Ep­ping of about thirty pounds a year, and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fet­ter Lane, which yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any dan­ger of leav­ing my fam­ily upon the parish.

I took leave of my wife and boy and girl with tears on both sides, and went on board the Ad­ven­ture, a mer­chant ship of three hun­dred tons, bound for Surat, Cap­tain John Nicholas of Liv­er­pool, com­man­der. But my ac­count of this voy­age must be re­ferred to the Sec­ond Part of my trav­els."/>

We had a very pros­per­ous gale till we ar­rived at the Cape of Good Hope, where we landed for fresh wa­ter; but dis­cov­er­ing a leak, we un­shipped our goods and win­tered there; for the cap­tain fall­ing sick of an ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March. We then set sail, and had a good voy­age till we passed the straits of Mada­gas­car; but hav­ing got north­ward of that is­land, and to about five de­grees south lat­i­tude, the winds, which in those seas are ob­served to blow a con­stant equal gale be­tween the north and west from the be­gin­ning of De­cem­ber to the be­gin­ning of May, on the 19th of April be­gan to blow with much greater vi­o­lence and more west­erly than usual, con­tin­u­ing so for twenty days to­gether; dur­ing which time we were driven a lit­tle to the east of the Molucca Is­lands, and about three de­grees north­ward of the line, as our cap­tain found by an ob­ser­va­tion he took the 2d of May, at which time the wind ceased, and it was a per­fect calm; whereat I was not a lit­tle re­joiced. But he, be­ing a man well ex­pe­ri­enced in the nav­i­ga­tion of those seas, bid us all pre­pare against a storm, which ac­cord­ingly hap­pened on the day fol­low­ing; for a south­ern wind, called the south­ern mon­soon, be­gan to set in."/>

We reefed the fore­sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore­sheet; the helm was hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We be­layed the fore-down­haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard and got the sail into the ship, and un­bound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dan­ger­ous. We hauled off upon the lan­yard of the whip­staff and helped the man at helm. We would not get down our top­mast, but let all stand, be­cause she scud­ded be­fore the sea very well, and we knew that the top­mast be­ing aloft, the ship was the whole­somer and made bet­ter way through the sea, see­ing we had sea room. When the storm was over we set fore­sail and main­sail and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizzen, main-top­sail and the fore-top­sail. Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at south­west. We got the star­board tacks aboard; we cast off our weather braces and lifts; we set in the lee braces and hauled for­ward by the weather bowl­ings, and hauled them tight, and be­layed them, and hauled over the mizzen-tack to wind­ward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie."/>

                <ITEXT CH="On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the top­mast dis­cov­ered land. On the 17th we came in full view of a great is­land, or con­ti­nent (for we knew not whether), on the south side whereof was a small neck of land jut­ting out into the sea, and a creek too shal­low to hold a ship of above one hun­dred tons. We cast an­chor within a league of this creek, and our cap­tain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long­boat, with ves­sels for wa­ter, if any could be found. I de­sired his leave to go with them, that I might see the coun­try and make what dis­cov­er­ies I could. When we came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of in­hab­i­tants. Our men there­fore wan­dered on the shore to find out some fresh wa­ter near the sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I ob­served the coun­try all bar­ren and rocky. I now be­gan to be weary, and see­ing noth­ing to en­ter­tain my cu­rios­ity, I re­turned gen­tly down to­wards the creek; and the sea be­ing full in my view, I saw our men al­ready got into the boat and row­ing for life to the ship. I was go­ing to holla af­ter them, al­though it had been to lit­tle pur­pose, when I ob­served a huge crea­ture walk­ing af­ter them in the sea, as fast as he could; he waded not much deeper than his knees, and took prodi­gious strides. But our men had the start of him half a league, and the sea there­abouts be­ing full of sharp-pointed rocks, the mon­ster was not able to over­take the boat. This I was af­ter­wards told, for I durst not stay to see the is­sue of that ad­ven­ture, but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then climbed up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the coun­try. I found it fully cul­ti­vated; but that which first sur­prised me was the length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was above twenty feet high."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I fell into a high­road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the in­hab­i­tants only as a foot­path through a field of bar­ley. Here I walked on for some time, but could see lit­tle on ei­ther side, it be­ing now near har­vest, and the corn ris­ing at least forty feet. I was an hour walk­ing to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hun­dred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could make no com­pu­ta­tion of their al­ti­tude. There was a stile to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps, and a stone to cross over when you came to the up­per­most. It was im­pos­si­ble for me to climb this stile, be­cause ev­ery step was six feet high, and the up­per stone above twenty. I was en­deav­or­ing to find some gap in the hedge, when I dis­cov­ered one of the in­hab­i­tants in the next field ad­vanc­ing to­wards the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pur­su­ing our boat. He ap­peared as tall as an or­di­nary spire steeple, and took about ten yards at ev­ery stride, as near as I could guess. I was struck with the ut­most fear and as­ton­ish­ment, and ran to hide my­self in the corn, whence I saw him at the top of the stile look­ing back into the next field on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many de­grees louder than a speak­ing trum­pet; but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I cer­tainly thought it was thun­der. Where­upon seven mon­sters like him­self came to­wards him with reap­ing hooks in their hands, each hook about the large­ness of six scythes. These peo­ple were not so well clad as the first, whose ser­vants or la­bor­ers they seemed to be; for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I kept from them at as great a dis­tance as I could, but was forced to move with ex­treme dif­fi­culty, for the stalks of the corn were some­times not above a foot dis­tant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body be­twixt them. How­ever, I made a shift to go for­ward till I came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind. Here it was im­pos­si­ble for me to ad­vance a step; for the stalks were so in­ter­wo­ven that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers not above a hun­dred yards be­hind me. Be­ing quite dispir­ited with toil, and wholly over­come by grief and de­spair, I lay down be­tween two ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days. I be­moaned my des­o­late widow and fa­ther­less chil­dren. I lamented my own folly and will­ful­ness in at­tempt­ing a sec­ond voy­age against the ad­vice of all my friends and re­la­tions. In this ter­ri­ble ag­i­ta­tion of mind I could not for­bear think­ing of Lil­liput, whose in­hab­i­tants looked upon me as the great­est prodigy that ever ap­peared in the world; where I was able to draw an im­pe­rial fleet in my hand, and per­form those other ac­tions which will be recorded for­ever in the chron­i­cles of that em­pire, while pos­ter­ity shall hardly be­lieve them, al­though at­tested by mil­lions. I re­flected what a mor­ti­fi­ca­tion it must prove to me to ap­pear as in­con­sid­er­able in this na­tion as one sin­gle Lil­liputian would be among us. But this I con­ceived was to be the least of my mis­for­tunes; for, as hu­man crea­tures are ob­served to be more sav­age and cruel in pro­por­tion to their bulk, what could I ex­pect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enor­mous bar­bar­ians that should hap­pen to seize me? Un­doubt­edly philoso­phers are in the right when they tell us that noth­ing is great or lit­tle oth­er­wise than by com­par­i­son. It might have pleased for­tune to let the Lil­liputians find some na­tion where the peo­ple were as diminu­tive with re­spect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but that even this prodi­gious race of mor­tals might be equally over­matched in some dis­tant part of the world, whereof we have yet no dis­cov­ery? Scared and con­founded as I was, I could not for­bear go­ing on with these re­flec­tions, when one of the reapers ap­proach­ing within ten yards of the ridge where I lay, made me ap­pre­hend that with the next step I should be squashed to death un­der his foot, or cut in two with his reap­ing hook. And there­fore when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me; where­upon the huge crea­ture trod short, and look­ing round about un­der him for some time, at last es­pied me as I lay on the ground. He con­sid­ered awhile, with the cau­tion of one who en­deav­ors to lay hold on a small dan­ger­ous an­i­mal in such a man­ner that it shall not be able ei­ther to scratch or to bite him, as I my­self have some­times done with a weasel in Eng­land. At length he ven­tured to take me up be­hind, by the mid­dle, be­tween his fore­fin­ger and thumb, and brought me within three yards of his eyes, that he might be­hold my shape more per­fectly. I guessed his mean­ing, and my good for­tune gave me so much pres­ence of mind, that I re­solved not to strug­gle in the least as he held me in the air above sixty feet from the ground, al­though he griev­ously pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fin­gers. All I ven­tured was to raise my eyes to­wards the sun and place my hands to­gether in a sup­pli­cat­ing pos­ture, and to speak some words in a hum­ble melan­choly tone, suit­able to the con­di­tion I then was in; for I ap­pre­hended ev­ery mo­ment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usu­ally do any lit­tle hate­ful an­i­mal which we have a mind to de­stroy. But my good star would have it, that he ap­peared pleased with my voice and ges­tures, and be­gan to look upon me as a cu­rios­ity, much won­der­ing to hear me pro­nounce ar­tic­u­late words, al­though he could not un­der­stand them. In the mean­time I was not able to for­bear groan­ing and shed­ding tears, and turn­ing my head to­wards my sides; let­ting him know, as well as I could, how cru­elly I was hurt by the pres­sure of his thumb and fin­ger. He seemed to ap­pre­hend my mean­ing; for, lift­ing up the lap­pet of his coat, he put me gen­tly into it, and im­me­di­ately ran along with me to his mas­ter, who was a sub­stan­tial farmer, and the same per­son I had first seen in the field."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The farmer hav­ing (as I sup­posed by their talk) re­ceived such an ac­count of me as his ser­vant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about the size of a walk­ing staff, and there­with lifted up the lap­pets of my coat, which, it seems, he thought to be some kind of cov­er­ing that na­ture had given me. He blew my hair aside to take a bet­ter view of my face. He called his hands about him, and asked them, as I af­ter­wards learned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any lit­tle crea­ture that re­sem­bled me. He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but I got im­me­di­ately up, and walked slowly back­wards and for­wards, to let those peo­ple see I had no in­tent to run away. They all sat down in a cir­cle about me, the bet­ter to ob­serve my mo­tions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow to­wards the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke sev­eral words as loud as I could. I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly pre­sented it to him. He re­ceived it on the palm of his hand, then ap­plied it close to his eye to see what it was, and af­ter­wards turned it sev­eral times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve), but could make noth­ing of it. Where­upon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I then took the purse, and open­ing it, poured all the gold into his palm. There were six Span­ish pieces of four pis­toles each, be­sides twenty or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his lit­tle fin­ger upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then an­other, but he seemed to be wholly ig­no­rant what they were. He made me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which af­ter of­fer­ing it to him sev­eral times, I thought it best to do."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The farmer by this time was con­vinced I must be a ra­tio­nal crea­ture. He spoke of­ten to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like that of a wa­ter­mill, yet his words were ar­tic­u­late enough. I an­swered as loud as I could in sev­eral lan­guages, and he of­ten laid his ear within two yards of me, but all in vain, for we were wholly un­in­tel­li­gi­ble to each other. He then sent his ser­vants to their work, and tak­ing his hand­ker­chief out of his pocket, he dou­bled and spread it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm up­wards, mak­ing me a sign to step into it, as I could eas­ily do, for it was not above a foot in thick­ness. I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of fall­ing, laid my­self at full length upon the hand­ker­chief, with the re­main­der of which he lapped me up to the head for fur­ther se­cu­rity, and in this man­ner car­ried me home to his house. There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in Eng­land do at the sight of a toad or a spi­der. How­ever, when she had awhile seen my be­hav­ior, and how well I ob­served the signs her hus­band made, she was soon rec­on­ciled, and by de­grees grew ex­tremely ten­der of me."/>

                <ITEXT CH="It was about twelve at noon and a ser­vant brought in din­ner. It was only one sub­stan­tial dish of meat (fit for the plain con­di­tion of a hus­band­man), in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet di­am­e­ter. The com­pany were the farmer and his wife, three chil­dren, and an old grand­mother. When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some dis­tance from him on the ta­ble, which was thirty feet high from the floor. I was in a ter­ri­ble fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge for fear of fall­ing. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crum­bled some bread on a trencher, and placed it be­fore me. I made her a low bow, took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them ex­ceed­ing de­light. The mis­tress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held about three gal­lons, and filled it with drink; I took up the ves­sel with much dif­fi­culty in both hands, and in a most re­spect­ful man­ner drank to her la­dy­ship’s health, ex­press­ing the words as loud as I could in Eng­lish, which made the com­pany laugh so heartily that I was al­most deaf­ened with the noise. This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was not un­pleas­ant. Then the mas­ter made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the ta­ble, be­ing in great sur­prise all the time, as the in­dul­gent reader will eas­ily con­ceive and ex­cuse, I hap­pened to stum­ble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but re­ceived no hurt. I got up im­me­di­ately, and ob­serv­ing the good peo­ple to be in much con­cern, I took my hat (which I held un­der my arm out of good man­ners), and wav­ing it over my head, gave three huz­zas, to show I had got no mis­chief by my fall. But ad­vanc­ing for­wards to­wards my mas­ter (as I shall hence­forth call him), his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in the air that I trem­bled in ev­ery limb; but his fa­ther snatched me from him, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear as would have felled a Eu­ro­pean troop of horse to the earth, or­der­ing him to be taken from the ta­ble. But be­ing afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well re­mem­ber­ing how mis­chievous all chil­dren among us nat­u­rally are to spar­rows, rab­bits, young kit­tens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and point­ing to the boy, made my mas­ter to un­der­stand as well as I could, that I de­sired his son might be par­doned. The fa­ther com­plied, and the lad took his seat again, where­upon I went to him and kissed his hand, which my mas­ter took, and made him stroke me gen­tly with it."/>

                <ITEXT CH="In the midst of din­ner, my mis­tress’s fa­vorite cat leaped into her lap. I heard a noise be­hind me like that of a dozen stock­ing weavers at work; and turn­ing my head, I found it pro­ceeded from the purring of this an­i­mal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I com­puted by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mis­tress was feed­ing and stroking her. The fierce­ness of this crea­ture’s coun­te­nance al­to­gether dis­com­posed me, though I stood at the fur­ther end of the ta­ble, above fifty feet off; and though my mis­tress held her fast, for fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons. But it hap­pened there was no dan­ger, for the cat took not the least no­tice of me when my mas­ter placed me within three yards of her. And as I have been al­ways told, and found true by ex­pe­ri­ence in my trav­els, that fly­ing, or dis­cov­er­ing fear, be­fore a fierce an­i­mal is a cer­tain way to make it pur­sue or at­tack you; so I re­solved, in this dan­ger­ous junc­ture, to show no man­ner of con­cern. I walked with in­tre­pid­ity five or six times be­fore the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; where­upon she drew her­self back, as if she were more afraid of me. I had less ap­pre­hen­sion con­cern­ing the dogs, whereof three or four came into the room, as it is usual in farm­ers’ houses; one of which was a mas­tiff equal in bulk to four ele­phants, and a grey-hound some­what taller than the mas­tiff, but not so large."/>

                <ITEXT CH="When din­ner was al­most done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old in her arms, who im­me­di­ately spied me, and be­gan a squall that you might have heard from Lon­don Bridge to Chelsea, af­ter the usual or­a­tory of in­fants, to get me for a play­thing. The mother, out of pure in­dul­gence, took me up, and put me to­wards the child, who presently seized me by the mid­dle, and got my head in his mouth, where I roared so loud that the urchin was frighted, and let me drop; and I should in­fal­li­bly have broke my neck, if the mother had not held her apron un­der me. The nurse, to quiet her babe, made use of a rat­tle, which was a kind of hol­low ves­sel filled with great stones, and fas­tened by a ca­ble to the child’s waist; but all in vain, so that she was forced to ap­ply the last rem­edy by giv­ing it suck. I must con­fess no ob­ject ever dis­gusted me so much as the sight of her mon­strous breast, which I can­not tell what to com­pare with, so as to give the cu­ri­ous reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and color. I had a near sight of her, she sit­ting down the more con­ve­niently to give suck, and I stand­ing on the ta­ble. This made me re­flect upon the fair skins of our Eng­lish ladies, who ap­pear so beau­ti­ful to us only be­cause they are of our own size, and their de­fects not to be seen but through a mag­ni­fy­ing glass; where we find by ex­per­i­ment that the smoothest and whitest skins look rough and coarse, and ill col­ored."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I re­mem­ber when I was at Lil­liput, the com­plex­ions of those diminu­tive peo­ple ap­peared to me the fairest in the world; and talk­ing upon this sub­ject with a per­son of learn­ing there, who was an in­ti­mate friend of mine, he said that my face ap­peared much fairer and smoother when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view when I took him up in my hand and brought him close, which he con­fessed was at first a very shock­ing sight. He said he could dis­cover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bris­tles of a boar, and my com­plex­ion made up of sev­eral col­ors, al­to­gether dis­agree­able. Al­though I must beg leave to say for my­self, that I am as fair as most of my sex and coun­try, and very lit­tle sun­burned by all my trav­els. On the other side, dis­cours­ing of the ladies in that em­peror’s court, he used to tell me one had freck­les, an­other too wide a mouth, a third too large a nose; noth­ing of which I was able to dis­tin­guish. I con­fess this re­flec­tion was ob­vi­ous enough; which, how­ever, I could not for­bear, lest the reader might think those vast crea­tures were ac­tu­ally de­formed: for I must do them the jus­tice to say they are a comely race of peo­ple; and par­tic­u­larly the fea­tures of my mas­ter’s coun­te­nance, al­though he were but a farmer, when I be­held him from the height of sixty feet, ap­peared very well pro­por­tioned."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife and chil­dren, which ag­gra­vated my sor­rows when I awaked and found my­self alone in a vast room, be­tween two and three hun­dred feet wide, and above two hun­dred high, ly­ing in a bed twenty yards wide. My mis­tress was gone about her house­hold af­fairs, and had locked me in. The bed was eight yards from the floor. While I was un­der these cir­cum­stances, two rats crept up the cur­tains, and ran smelling back­wards and for­wards on the bed. One of them came up al­most to my face, where­upon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to de­fend my­self. These hor­ri­ble an­i­mals had the bold­ness to at­tack me on both sides, and one of them held his forefeet at my col­lar; but I had the good for­tune to rip up his belly be­fore he could do me any mis­chief. He fell down at my feet, and the other, see­ing the fate of his com­rade, made his es­cape, but not with­out one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trick­ling from him. Af­ter this ex­ploit I walked gen­tly to and fro on the bed, to re­cover my breath and loss of spir­its. These crea­tures were of the size of a large mas­tiff, but in­fin­itely more nim­ble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt be­fore I went to sleep, I must have in­fal­li­bly been torn to pieces and de­voured. I mea­sured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long, want­ing an inch; but it went against my stom­ach to drag the car­cass off the bed, where it lay still bleed­ing. I ob­served it had yet some life, but with a strong slash across the neck I thor­oughly dis­patched it."/>

Then she set me on a ta­ble, where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wip­ing it on the lap­pet of my coat re­turned it to the scab­bard."/>

Her mother and she con­trived to fit up the baby’s cra­dle for me against night. The cra­dle was put into a small drawer of a cab­i­net, and the drawer placed upon a hang­ing shelf for fear of the rats. This was my bed all the time I stayed with those peo­ple, though made more con­ve­nient by de­grees, as I be­gan to learn their lan­guage and make my wants known. This young girl was so handy, that af­ter I had once or twice pulled off my clothes be­fore her, she was able to dress and un­dress me, though I never gave her that trou­ble when she would let me do ei­ther my­self. She made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which in­deed was coarser than sack­cloth; and these she con­stantly washed for me with her own hands. She was like­wise my school-mis­tress, to teach me the lan­guage; when I pointed to any­thing, she told me the name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for what­ever I had a mind to. She was very good-na­tured, and not above forty feet high, be­ing lit­tle for her age. She gave me the name of Grildrig, which the fam­ily took up, and af­ter­wards the whole king­dom.

                <ITEXT CH=", but ex­actly shaped in ev­ery part like a hu­man crea­ture; which it like­wise im­i­tated in all its ac­tions; seemed to speak in a lit­tle lan­guage of its own, had al­ready learned sev­eral words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gen­tle, would come when it was called, do what­ever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a com­plex­ion fairer than a no­ble­man’s daugh­ter of three years old. An­other farmer, who lived hard by, and was a par­tic­u­lar friend of my mas­ter, came on a visit on pur­pose to in­quire into the truth of this story. I was im­me­di­ately pro­duced and placed upon a ta­ble, where I walked as I was com­manded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my rev­er­ence to my mas­ter’s guest, asked him in his own lan­guage how he did, and told him he was wel­come, just as my lit­tle nurse had in­structed me. This man, who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spec­ta­cles to be­hold me bet­ter; at which I could not for­bear laugh­ing very heartily, for his eyes ap­peared like the full moon shin­ing into a cham­ber at two win­dows. Our peo­ple, who dis­cov­ered the cause of my mirth, bore me com­pany in laugh­ing, at which the old fel­low was fool enough to be an­gry and out of coun­te­nance. He had the char­ac­ter of a great miser; and, to my mis­for­tune, he well de­served it by the cursed ad­vice he gave my mas­ter to show me as a sight upon a mar­ket day in the next town, which was half an hour’s rid­ing, about two-and-twenty miles from our house. I guessed there was some mis­chief con­triv­ing, when I ob­served my mas­ter and his friend whis­per­ing long to­gether, some­times point­ing at me; and my fears made me fancy that I over­heard and un­der­stood some of their words. But the next morn­ing Glum­dal­clitch, my lit­tle nurse, told me the whole mat­ter, which she had cun­ningly picked out from her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bo­som, and fell a-weep­ing with shame and grief. She ap­pre­hended some mis­chief would hap­pen to me from rude vul­gar folks, who might squeeze me to death or break one of my limbs by tak­ing me in their hands. She had also ob­served how mod­est I was in my na­ture, how nicely I re­garded my honor, and what an in­dig­nity I should con­ceive it to be ex­posed for money as a pub­lic spec­ta­cle to the mean­est of the peo­ple. She said, her papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pre­tended to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher. For my own part, I may truly af­firm that I was less con­cerned than my nurse. I had a strong hope which never left me, that I should one day re­cover my lib­erty; and as to the ig­nominy of be­ing car­ried about for a mon­ster, I con­sid­ered my­self to be a per­fect stranger in the coun­try, and that such a mis­for­tune could never be charged upon me as a re­proach if ever I should re­turn to Eng­land; since the king of Great Britain him­self, in my con­di­tion, must have un­der­gone the same dis­tress."/>

The box was close on ev­ery side, with a lit­tle door for me to go in and out, and a few gim­let holes to let in air. The girl had been so care­ful as to put the quilt of her baby’s bed into it for me to lie down on.

I walked about on the ta­ble as the girl com­manded; she asked me ques­tions as far as she knew my un­der­stand­ing of the lan­guage reached, and I an­swered them as loud as I could. I turned about sev­eral times to the com­pany, paid my hum­ble re­spects, said they were wel­come, and used some other speeches I had been taught. I took up a thim­ble filled with liquor, which Glum­dal­clitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health. I drew out my hanger, and flour­ished with it af­ter the man­ner of fencers in Eng­land. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I ex­er­cised as a pike, hav­ing learned the art in my youth. I was that day shown to twelve sets of com­pany, and as of­ten forced to go over again with the same fop­peries, till I was half dead with weari­ness and vex­a­tion; for those who had seen me made such won­der­ful re­ports, that the peo­ple were ready to break down the doors to come in. My mas­ter, for his own in­ter­est, would not suf­fer any one to touch me ex­cept my nurse; and to pre­vent dan­ger, benches were set round the ta­ble at such a dis­tance as to put me out of ev­ery­body’s reach. How­ever, an un­lucky school­boy aimed a hazel­nut di­rectly at my head, which very nar­rowly missed me; oth­er­wise it came with so much vi­o­lence that it would have in­fal­li­bly knocked out my brains, for it was al­most as large as a small pump­kin; but I had the sat­is­fac­tion to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the room."/>

The girl had lined it on all sides with the soft­est cloth she could get, well quilted un­der­neath, fur­nished it with her baby’s bed, pro­vided me with linen and other nec­es­saries, and made ev­ery­thing as con­ve­nient as she could. We had no other com­pany but a boy of the house, who rode af­ter us with the lug­gage."/>

He, who ap­pre­hended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part with me, and de­manded a thou­sand pieces of gold, which were or­dered him on the spot, each piece be­ing about the big­ness of eight hun­dred moidores; but al­low­ing for the pro­por­tion of all things be­tween that coun­try and Eu­rope, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thou­sand guineas would be in Eng­land. I then said to the queen, since I was now her majesty’s most hum­ble crea­ture and vas­sal, I must beg the fa­vor that Glum­dal­clitch, who had al­ways tended me with so much care and kind­ness, and un­der­stood to do it so well, might be ad­mit­ted into her ser­vice, and con­tinue to be my nurse and in­struc­tor. Her majesty agreed to my pe­ti­tion, and eas­ily got the farmer’s con­sent, who was glad enough to have his daugh­ter pre­ferred at court; and the poor girl her­self was not able to hide her joy. My late mas­ter with­drew, bid­ding me farewell, and say­ing he had left me in a good ser­vice; to which I replied not a word, only mak­ing him a slight bow."/>

He de­sired the queen to or­der that a par­tic­u­lar care should be taken of me; and was of opin­ion that Glum­dal­clitch should still con­tinue in her of­fice of tend­ing me, be­cause he ob­served we had a great af­fec­tion for each other. A con­ve­nient apart­ment was pro­vided for her at court; she had a sort of gov­erness ap­pointed to take care of her ed­u­ca­tion, a maid to dress her, and two other ser­vants for me­nial of­fices; but the care of me was wholly ap­pro­pri­ated to her­self. The queen com­manded her own cab­i­net­maker to con­trive a box that might serve me for a bed­cham­ber, af­ter the model that Glum­dal­clitch and I should agree upon. This man was a most in­ge­nious artist, and ac­cord­ing to my di­rec­tions, in three weeks fin­ished for me a wooden cham­ber of six­teen feet square, and twelve high, with sash win­dows, a door, and two clos­ets, like a Lon­don bed­cham­ber. The board that made the ceil­ing was to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready fur­nished by her majesty’s up­hol­sterer, which Glum­dal­clitch took out ev­ery day to air, made it with her own hands, and let­ting it down at night, locked up the roof over me. A nice work­man, who was fa­mous for lit­tle cu­riosi­ties, un­der­took to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a sub­stance not un­like ivory, and two ta­bles, with a cab­i­net to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceil­ing, to pre­vent any ac­ci­dent from the care­less­ness of those who car­ried me, and to break the force of a jolt when I went in a coach. I de­sired a lock for my door, to pre­vent rats and mice from com­ing in. The smith, af­ter sev­eral at­tempts, made the small­est that ever was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gen­tle­man’s house in Eng­land. I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fear­ing Glum­dal­clitch might lose it. The queen like­wise or­dered the thinnest silks that could be got­ten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an Eng­lish blan­ket, very cum­ber­some till I was ac­cus­tomed to them. They were af­ter the fash­ion of the king­dom, partly re­sem­bling the Per­sian, and partly the Chi­nese, and are a very grave de­cent habit."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The queen be­came so fond of my com­pany that she could not dine with­out me. I had a ta­ble placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at her left el­bow, and a chair to sit on. Glum­dal­clitch stood on a stool on the floor, near my ta­ble, to as­sist and take care of me. I had an en­tire set of sil­ver dishes and plates, and other nec­es­saries, which in pro­por­tion to those of the queen, were not much big­ger than what I have seen of the same kind in a Lon­don toy-shop, for the fur­ni­ture of a baby-house; these my lit­tle nurse kept in her pocket in a sil­ver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them, al­ways clean­ing them her­self. No per­son dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the el­der six­teen years old, and the younger at that time thir­teen and a month. Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for my­self; and her di­ver­sion was to see me eat in minia­ture; for the queen (who had in­deed but a weak stom­ach) took up at one mouth­ful as much as a dozen Eng­lish farm­ers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very nau­seous sight. She would crunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, be­tween her teeth, al­though it were nine times as large as that of a full-grown tur­key; and put a bit of bread in her mouth, as big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe set straight upon the han­dle; the spoons, forks, and other in­stru­ments were all in the same pro­por­tion. I re­mem­ber when Glum­dal­clitch car­ried me, out of cu­rios­ity, to see some of the ta­bles at court, where ten or a dozen of these enor­mous knives and forks were lifted up to­gether, I thought I had never till then be­held so ter­ri­ble a sight."/>

                <ITEXT CH="It is the cus­tom that ev­ery Wednes­day (which, as I have ob­served, is their Sab­bath) the king and queen, with the royal is­sue of both sexes, dine to­gether in the apart­ment of his majesty, to whom I was now be­come a great fa­vorite; and at these times my lit­tle chair and ta­ble were placed at his left hand be­fore one of the salt-cel­lars. This prince took a plea­sure in con­vers­ing with me, in­quir­ing into the man­ners, re­li­gion, laws, gov­ern­ment, and learn­ing of Eu­rope, wherein I gave him the best ac­count I was able. His ap­pre­hen­sion was so clear and his judg­ment so ex­act that he made very wise re­flec­tions and ob­ser­va­tions upon all I said. But I con­fess that af­ter I had been a lit­tle too co­pi­ous in talk­ing of my own beloved coun­try, of our trade and wars by sea and land, of our schisms in re­li­gion, and par­ties in the state, the prej­u­dices of his ed­u­ca­tion pre­vailed so far that he could not for­bear tak­ing me up in his right hand and stroking me gen­tly with the other, af­ter a hearty fit of laugh­ing, asked me whether I were a Whig or a Tory. Then turn­ing to his first min­is­ter, who waited be­hind him with a white staff, near as tall as the main­mast of the Royal Sov­er­eign, he ob­served how con­temptible a thing was hu­man grandeur, which could be mim­icked by such diminu­tive in­sects as I. “And yet,” said he, “I dare en­gage these crea­tures have their ti­tles and dis­tinc­tions of honor; they con­trive lit­tle nests and bur­rows, that they call houses and cities; they make a fig­ure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dis­pute, they cheat, they be­tray.” And thus he con­tin­ued on, while my color came and went sev­eral times with in­dig­na­tion to hear our no­ble coun­try, the mis­tress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the ar­bi­tress of Eu­rope, the seat of virtue, piety, honor, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so con­temp­tu­ously treated."/>

Nei­ther, in­deed, could I for­bear smil­ing at my­self when the queen used to place me upon her hand to­wards a look­ing-glass, by which both our per­sons ap­peared be­fore me in full view to­gether; and there could noth­ing be more ridicu­lous than the com­par­i­son; so that I re­ally be­gan to imag­ine my­self dwin­dled many de­grees be­low my usual size."/>

One day at din­ner, this ma­li­cious lit­tle cub was so net­tled with some­thing I had said to him, that, rais­ing him­self upon the frame of her majesty’s chair, he took me up by the mid­dle, as I was sit­ting down, not think­ing any harm, and let me drop into a large sil­ver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I fell over head and ears, and if I had not been a good swim­mer it might have gone very hard with me; for Glum­dal­clitch in that in­stant hap­pened to be at the other end of the room, and the queen was in such a fright that she wanted pres­ence of mind to as­sist me. But my lit­tle nurse ran to my re­lief, and took me out, af­ter I had swal­lowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed; how­ever, I re­ceived no other dam­age than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was ut­terly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and as a fur­ther pun­ish­ment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown me. Nei­ther was he ever re­stored to fa­vor; for soon af­ter the queen be­stowed him on a lady of high qual­ity, so that I saw him no more, to my very great sat­is­fac­tion: for I could not tell to what ex­trem­ity such a ma­li­cious urchin might have car­ried his re­sent­ment."/>

Her majesty had taken a mar­row­bone upon her plate, and, af­ter knock­ing out the mar­row, placed the bone again on the dish erect, as it stood be­fore; the dwarf, watch­ing his op­por­tu­nity, while Glum­dal­clitch was gone to the side­board, mounted upon the stool she stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeez­ing my legs to­gether, wedged them into the mar­row­bone above my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridicu­lous fig­ure. I be­lieve it was near a minute be­fore any one knew what was be­come of me, for I thought it be­low me to cry out.

They would some­times alight upon my vict­uals. Some­times they would fix upon my nose or fore­head, where they stung me to the quick, smelling very of­fen­sively; and I could eas­ily trace that vis­cous mat­ter which, our nat­u­ral­ists tell us, en­ables those crea­tures to walk with their feet up­wards upon a ceil­ing. I had much ado to de­fend my­self against these de­testable an­i­mals, and could not for­bear start­ing when they came on my face. It was the com­mon prac­tice of the dwarf to catch a num­ber of these in­sects in his hand, as school­boys do among us, and let them out sud­denly un­der my nose, on pur­pose to frighten me, and di­vert the queen.

But the large rivers are full of ves­sels, and abound with ex­cel­lent fish; for they sel­dom get any from the sea, be­cause the sea fish are of the same size with those in Eu­rope, and con­se­quently not worth catch­ing; whereby it is man­i­fest, that na­ture, in the pro­duc­tion of plants and an­i­mals of so ex­tra­or­di­nary a bulk, is wholly con­fined to this con­ti­nent, of which I leave the rea­sons to be de­ter­mined by philoso­phers.

I reck­oned our coach to be about a square of West­min­ster Hall, but not al­to­gether so high; how­ever, I can­not be very ex­act.

This trav­el­ing closet was an ex­act square, with a win­dow in the mid­dle of three of the squares, and each win­dow was lat­ticed with iron wire on the out­side, to pre­vent ac­ci­dents in long jour­neys. On the fourth side, which had no win­dow, two strong sta­ples were fixed, through which the per­son that car­ried me, when I had a mind to be on horse­back, put in a leather belt, and buck­led it about his waist. This was al­ways the of­fice of some grave trusty ser­vant in whom I could con­fide, whether I at­tended the king and queen in their pro­gresses, or were dis­posed to see the gar­dens, or pay a visit to some great lady or min­is­ter of state in the court, when Glum­dal­clitch hap­pened to be out of or­der; for I soon be­gan to be known and es­teemed among the great­est of­fi­cers, I sup­pose more upon ac­count of their majesties’ fa­vor than any merit of my own. In jour­neys, when I was weary of the coach, a ser­vant on horse­back would buckle my box, and place it on a cush­ion be­fore him; and there I had a full prospect of the coun­try on three sides from my three win­dows. I had in this closet a field bed, and a ham­mock hung from the ceil­ing, two chairs and a ta­ble, neatly screwed to the floor, to pre­vent be­ing tossed by the ag­i­ta­tion of the horse or the coach.

The peo­ple, who had of­ten heard of me, were very cu­ri­ous to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was com­plaisant enough to make the bear­ers stop, and to take me in her hand that I might be more con­ve­niently seen."/>

I mea­sured a lit­tle fin­ger which had fallen down from one of these stat­ues, and lay un­per­ceived among some rub­bish, and found it ex­actly four feet and an inch in length.

In the mean­time, there sud­denly fell such a vi­o­lent shower of hail, that I was im­me­di­ately, by the force of it, struck to the ground; and when I was down, the hail­stones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I had been pelted with ten­nis balls; how­ever, I made a shift to creep on all fours, and shel­ter my­self by ly­ing flat on my face on the lee side of a bor­der of lemon-thyme; but so bruised from head to foot that I could not go abroad in ten days. Nei­ther is this at all to be won­dered at, be­cause na­ture in that coun­try ob­serv­ing the same pro­por­tion through all her op­er­a­tions, a hail­stone is near eigh­teen hun­dred times as large as one in Eu­rope; which I can as­sert upon ex­pe­ri­ence, hav­ing been so cu­ri­ous to weigh and mea­sure them."/>

                <ITEXT CH="But a more dan­ger­ous ac­ci­dent hap­pened to me in the same gar­den, when my lit­tle nurse, be­liev­ing she had put me in a se­cure place (which I of­ten en­treated her to do, that I might en­joy my own thoughts), and hav­ing left my box at home to avoid the trou­ble of car­ry­ing it, went to an­other part of the gar­den with her gov­erness and some ladies of her ac­quain­tance. While she was ab­sent, and out of hear­ing, a small white spaniel be­long­ing to one of the chief gar­den­ers, hav­ing got by ac­ci­dent into the gar­den, hap­pened to range near the place where I lay: the dog fol­low­ing the scent, came di­rectly up, and tak­ing me in his mouth, ran straight to his mas­ter, wag­ging his tail, and set me gen­tly on the ground. By good for­tune he had been so well taught, that I was car­ried be­tween his teeth with­out the least hurt, or even tear­ing my clothes. But the poor gar­dener, who knew me well, and had a great kind­ness for me, was in a ter­ri­ble fright; he gen­tly took me up in both his hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few min­utes I came to my­self, and he car­ried me safe to my lit­tle nurse, who by this time had re­turned to the place where she had left me, and was in cruel ag­o­nies when I did not ap­pear, nor an­swer when she called. She se­verely rep­ri­manded the gar­dener on ac­count of his dog. But the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was afraid of the queen’s anger; and truly, as to my­self, I thought it would not be for my rep­u­ta­tion that such a story should go about."/>

An­other time, walk­ing to the top of a fresh mole­hill, I fell to my neck in the hole through which that an­i­mal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth re­mem­ber­ing, to ex­cuse my­self for spoil­ing my clothes.

I re­mem­ber, a thrush had the con­fi­dence to snatch out of my hand with his bill a piece of cake that Glum­dal­clitch had just given me for my break­fast. When I at­tempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me, en­deav­or­ing to pick my fin­gers, which I durst not ven­ture within their reach; and then they would hop back un­con­cerned, to hunt for worms or snails as they did be­fore. But one day, I took a thick cud­gel, and threw it with all my strength so luck­ily at a lin­net, that I knocked him down, and seiz­ing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in tri­umph to my nurse. How­ever, the bird, who had only been stunned, re­cov­er­ing him­self, gave me so many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at arm’s length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty times think­ing to let him go. But I was soon re­lieved by one of our ser­vants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day for din­ner, by the queen’s com­mand. This lin­net, as near as I can re­mem­ber, seemed to be some­what larger than an Eng­lish swan."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The queen, who of­ten used to hear me talk of my sea voy­ages, and took all oc­ca­sions to di­vert me when I was melan­choly, asked me whether I un­der­stood how to han­dle a sail or an oar, and whether a lit­tle ex­er­cise of row­ing might not be con­ve­nient for my health. I an­swered that I un­der­stood both very well; for al­though my proper em­ploy­ment had been to be sur­geon or doc­tor to the ship, yet of­ten, upon a pinch, I was forced to work like a com­mon mariner. But I could not see how this could be done in their coun­try, where the small­est wherry was equal to a first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could man­age would never live in any of their rivers. Her majesty said, if I would con­trive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would pro­vide a place for me to sail in. The fel­low was an in­ge­nious work­man, and by my in­struc­tions, in ten days fin­ished a plea­sure boat, with all its tack­ling, able con­ve­niently to hold eight Eu­ro­peans. When it was fin­ished, the queen was so de­lighted that she ran with it in her lap to the king, who or­dered it to be put in a cis­tern full of wa­ter, with me in it, by way of trial, where I could not man­age my two sculls or lit­tle oars for want of room. But the queen had be­fore con­trived an­other project. She or­dered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hun­dred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which be­ing well pitched to pre­vent leak­ing, was placed on the floor along the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a cock near the bot­tom to let out the wa­ter when it be­gan to grow stale; and two ser­vants could eas­ily fill it in half an hour. Here I of­ten used to row for my own di­ver­sion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought them­selves well en­ter­tained with my skill and agility. Some­times I would put up my sail, and then my busi­ness was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and when they were weary, some of the pages would blow my sail for­ward with their breath, while I showed my art by steer­ing star­board or lar­board as I pleased. When I had done, Glum­dal­clitch al­ways car­ried back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry."/>

The frog lay con­cealed till I was put into my boat, but then, see­ing a rest­ing place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was forced to bal­ance it with all my weight on the other, to pre­vent over­turn­ing. When the frog was got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my head, back­wards and for­wards, daub­ing my face and clothes with its odi­ous slime.

                <ITEXT CH="But the great­est dan­ger I ever un­der­went in that king­dom was from a mon­key, who be­longed to one of the clerks of the kitchen. Glum­dal­clitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went some­where upon busi­ness, or a visit. The weather be­ing very warm, the closet win­dow was left open, as well as the win­dows and door of my big­ger box, in which I usu­ally lived, be­cause of its large­ness and con­ve­niency. As I sat qui­etly med­i­tat­ing at my ta­ble, I heard some­thing bounce in at the closet win­dow, and skip about from one side to the other; whereat, al­though I was much alarmed, yet I ven­tured to look out, but stirred not from my seat; and then I saw this frol­ic­some an­i­mal frisk­ing and leap­ing up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with great plea­sure and cu­rios­ity, peep­ing in at the door and ev­ery win­dow. I re­treated to the far­ther cor­ner of my room, or box; but the mon­key, look­ing in at ev­ery side, put me into such a fright, that I wanted pres­ence of mind to con­ceal my­self un­der the bed, as I might eas­ily have done. Af­ter some time spent in peep­ing, grin­ning, and chat­ter­ing, he at last es­pied me; and reach­ing one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does when she plays with a mouse, al­though I of­ten shifted place to avoid him, he at length seized the lap­pet of my coat (which be­ing made of that coun­try cloth, was very thick and strong) and dragged me out. He took me up in his right fore­foot, and held me as a nurse does a child she is go­ing to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of crea­ture do with a kit­ten in Eu­rope; and when I of­fered to strug­gle, he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more pru­dent to sub­mit. I have good rea­son to be­lieve that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his of­ten stroking my face very gen­tly with his other paw. In these di­ver­sions he was in­ter­rupted by a noise at the closet door, as if some­body were open­ing it; where­upon he sud­denly leaped up to the win­dow at which he had come in, and thence upon the leads and gut­ters, walk­ing upon three legs, and hold­ing me in the fourth, till he clam­bered up to a roof that was next to ours. I heard Glum­dal­clitch give a shriek at the mo­ment he was car­ry­ing me out. The poor girl was al­most dis­tracted; that quar­ter of the palace was all in an up­roar; the ser­vants ran for lad­ders; the mon­key was seen by hun­dreds in the court, sit­ting upon the ridge of a build­ing, hold­ing me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feed­ing me with the other, by cram­ming into my mouth some vict­uals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his chaps, and pat­ting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the rab­ble be­low could not for­bear laugh­ing; nei­ther do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for, with­out ques­tion, the sight was ridicu­lous enough to ev­ery­body but my­self.

He asked me what my thoughts and spec­u­la­tions were while I lay in the mon­key’s paw, how I liked the vict­uals he gave me, his man­ner of feed­ing, and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharp­ened my stom­ach. He de­sired to know what I would have done upon such an oc­ca­sion in my own coun­try. I told his majesty, that in Eu­rope we had no mon­keys ex­cept such as were brought for cu­riosi­ties from other places, and so small that I could deal with a dozen of them to­gether, if they pre­sumed to at­tack me. And as for that mon­strous an­i­mal with whom I was so lately en­gaged (it was in­deed as large as an ele­phant), if my fears had suf­fered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger (look­ing fiercely and clap­ping my hand upon the hilt as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my cham­ber, per­haps I should have given him such a wound as would have made him glad to with­draw it with more haste than he put it in. This I de­liv­ered in a firm tone, like a per­son who was jeal­ous lest his courage should be called in ques­tion. How­ever, my speech pro­duced noth­ing else be­sides a loud laugh­ter, which all the re­spect due to his majesty from those about him could not make them con­tain. This made me re­flect how vain an at­tempt it is for a man to en­deavor do­ing him­self honor among those who are out of all de­gree of equal­ity or com­par­i­son with him. And yet I have seen the moral of my own be­hav­ior very fre­quently in Eng­land since my re­turn; where a lit­tle con­temptible var­let, with­out the least ti­tle to birth, per­son, wit, or com­mon sense, shall pre­sume to look with im­por­tance, and put him­self upon a foot with the great­est per­sons of the king­dom."/>

To say the truth, it was more for show than use, be­ing not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coins, and there­fore she kept noth­ing in it but some lit­tle toys that girls are fond of."/>

A fancy came into my head that I would en­ter­tain the king and queen with an Eng­lish tune upon this in­stru­ment. But this ap­peared ex­tremely dif­fi­cult; for the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key be­ing al­most a foot wide, so that with my arms ex­tended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them down re­quired a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great a la­bor and to no pur­pose. The method I con­trived was this: I pre­pared two round sticks about the big­ness of com­mon cud­gels; they were thicker at one end than the other, and I cov­ered the thicker ends with a piece of a mouse’s skin, that by rap­ping on them I might nei­ther dam­age the tops of the keys nor in­ter­rupt the sound. Be­fore the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet be­low the keys, and I was put upon the bench. I ran sidel­ing upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, bang­ing the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the great sat­is­fac­tion of both their majesties; but it was the most vi­o­lent ex­er­cise I ever un­der­went; and yet I could not strike above six­teen keys, nor, con­se­quently, play the bass and tre­ble to­gether, as other artists do; which was a great dis­ad­van­tage to my per­for­mance."/>

That these were the or­na­ment and bul­wark of the king­dom, wor­thy fol­low­ers of their most renowned an­ces­tors, whose honor had been the re­ward of their virtue, from which their pos­ter­ity were never once known to de­gen­er­ate. To these were joined sev­eral holy per­sons, as part of that as­sem­bly, un­der the ti­tle of bish­ops, whose pe­cu­liar busi­ness it is to take care of re­li­gion, and of those who in­struct the peo­ple therein. These were searched and sought out through the whole na­tion, by the prince and his wis­est coun­selors, among such of the priest­hood as were most de­servedly dis­tin­guished by the sanc­tity of their lives, and the depth of their eru­di­tion; who were in­deed the spir­i­tual fa­thers of the clergy and the peo­ple."/>

And these two bod­ies make up the most au­gust as­sem­bly in Eu­rope, to whom, in con­junc­tion with the prince, the whole leg­is­la­ture is com­mit­ted."/>

What course was taken to sup­ply that as­sem­bly when any no­ble fam­ily be­came ex­tinct. What qual­i­fi­ca­tions were nec­es­sary in those who were to be cre­ated new lords. Whether the hu­mor of the prince, a sum of money to a court lady or a Prime Min­is­ter, or a de­sign of strength­en­ing a party op­po­site to the pub­lic in­ter­est, ever hap­pened to be mo­tives in those ad­vance­ments. What share of knowl­edge these lords had in the laws of their coun­try, and how they came by it, so as to en­able them to de­cide the prop­er­ties of their fel­low sub­jects in the last re­sort. Whether they were al­ways so free from avarice, par­tial­i­ties, or want, that a bribe, or some other sin­is­ter view, could have no place among them. Whether those holy lords I spoke of were al­ways pro­moted to that rank upon ac­count of their knowl­edge in re­li­gious mat­ters, and the sanc­tity of their lives, had never been com­pli­ers with the times while they were com­mon priests, or slav­ish pros­ti­tute chap­lains to some no­ble­man, whose opin­ions they con­tin­ued servilely to fol­low af­ter they were ad­mit­ted into that as­sem­bly."/>

How it came to pass, that peo­ple were so vi­o­lently bent upon get­ting into this as­sem­bly, which I al­lowed to be a great trou­ble and ex­pense, of­ten to the ruin of their fam­i­lies, with­out any salary or pen­sion; be­cause this ap­peared such an ex­alted strain of virtue and pub­lic spirit, that his majesty seemed to doubt it might pos­si­bly not be al­ways sin­cere. And he de­sired to know whether such zeal­ous gen­tle­men could have any views of re­fund­ing them­selves for the charges and trou­ble they were at, by sac­ri­fic­ing the pub­lic good to the de­signs of a weak and vi­cious prince in con­junc­tion with a cor­rupted min­istry. He mul­ti­plied his ques­tions, and sifted me thor­oughly upon ev­ery part of this head, propos­ing num­ber­less in­quiries and ob­jec­tions, which I think it not pru­dent or con­ve­nient to re­peat."/>

He asked what time was usu­ally spent in de­ter­min­ing be­tween right and wrong, and what de­gree of ex­pense.

But if what I told him were true, he was still at a loss how a king­dom could run out of its es­tate like a pri­vate per­son. He asked me who were our cred­i­tors; and where we should find money to pay them. He won­dered to hear me talk of such charge­able and ex­ten­sive wars; that cer­tainly we must be a quar­rel­some peo­ple, or live among very bad neigh­bors, and that our gen­er­als must needs be richer than our kings. He asked what busi­ness we had out of our own is­lands, un­less upon the score of trade or treaty, or to de­fend the coasts with our fleet. Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mer­ce­nary stand­ing army in the midst of peace, and among a free peo­ple. He said if we were gov­erned by our own con­sent in the per­sons of our rep­re­sen­ta­tives, he could not imag­ine of whom we were afraid, or against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opin­ion, whether a pri­vate man’s house might not bet­ter be de­fended by him­self, his chil­dren, and fam­ily, than by half a dozen ras­cals picked up at a ven­ture in the streets for small wages, who might get a hun­dred times more by cut­ting their throats."/>

He said he knew no rea­son why those who en­ter­tain opin­ions prej­u­di­cial to the pub­lic, should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to con­ceal them.

I ob­serve among you some lines of an in­sti­tu­tion which in its orig­i­nal might have been tol­er­a­ble, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blot­ted by cor­rup­tions. It does not ap­pear, from all you have said, how any one virtue is re­quired to­wards the pro­cure­ment of any one sta­tion among you; much less that men are en­no­bled on ac­count of their virtue; that priests are ad­vanced by their piety or learn­ing; sol­diers for their con­duct or valor; judges for their in­tegrity; sen­a­tors for the love of their coun­try; or coun­selors for their wis­dom. As for your­self,” con­tin­ued the king, “who have spent the great­est part of your life in trav­el­ing, I am well dis­posed to hope you may hith­erto have es­caped many vices of your coun­try. But by what I have gath­ered from your own re­la­tion, and the an­swers I have with much pains wringed and ex­torted from you, I can­not but con­clude the bulk of your na­tives to be the most per­ni­cious race of lit­tle odi­ous ver­min that na­ture ever suf­fered to crawl upon the sur­face of the earth.”"/>

In hopes to in­gra­ti­ate my­self fur­ther into his majesty’s fa­vor, I told him of an in­ven­tion dis­cov­ered be­tween three and four hun­dred years ago, to make a cer­tain pow­der, into a heap of which the small­est spark of fire fall­ing, would kin­dle the whole in a mo­ment, al­though it were as big as a moun­tain, and make it all fly up in the air to­gether, with a noise and ag­i­ta­tion greater than thun­der. That a proper quan­tity of this pow­der rammed into a hol­low tube of brass or iron, ac­cord­ing to its big­ness, would drive a ball of iron or lead with such a vi­o­lence and speed as noth­ing was able to sus­tain its force. That the largest balls thus dis­charged, would not only de­stroy whole ranks of an army at once, but bat­ter the strong­est walls to the ground; sink down ships with a thou­sand men in each, to the bot­tom of the sea; and when linked to­gether by a chain, would cut through masts and rig­ging, di­vide hun­dreds of bod­ies in the mid­dle, and lay all waste be­fore them. That we of­ten put this pow­der into large hol­low balls of iron, and dis­charged them by an en­gine into some city we were be­sieg­ing, which would rip up the pave­ments, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splin­ters on ev­ery side, dash­ing out the brains of all who came near. That I knew the in­gre­di­ents very well, which were cheap and com­mon; I un­der­stood the man­ner of com­pound­ing them, and could di­rect his work­men how to make those tubes of a size pro­por­tion­able to all other things in his majesty’s king­dom, and the largest need not be above a hun­dred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quan­tity of pow­der and balls, would bat­ter down the walls of the strong­est town in his do­min­ions in a few hours, or de­stroy the whole me­trop­o­lis, if ever it should pre­tend to dis­pute his ab­so­lute com­mands. This I humbly of­fered to his majesty as a small trib­ute of ac­knowl­edg­ment in re­turn of so many marks that I had re­ceived of his royal fa­vor and pro­tec­tion."/>

As for him­self, he protested that al­though few things de­lighted him so much as new dis­cov­er­ies in art or in na­ture, yet he would rather lose half his king­dom than be privy to such a se­cret, which he com­manded me, as I val­ued my life, never to men­tion any more."/>

For, I re­mem­ber very well, in a dis­course one day with the king, when I hap­pened to say there were sev­eral thou­sand books among us writ­ten upon the art of gov­ern­ment, it gave him (di­rectly con­trary to my in­ten­tion) a very mean opin­ion of our un­der­stand­ings.

He could not tell what I meant by se­crets of state, where an en­emy or some ri­val na­tion were not in the case. He con­fined the knowl­edge of gov­ern­ing within very nar­row bounds, to com­mon sense and rea­son, to jus­tice and lenity, to the speedy de­ter­mi­na­tion of civil and crim­i­nal causes; with some other ob­vi­ous top­ics which are not worth con­sid­er­ing.

I have pe­rused many of their books, es­pe­cially those in his­tory and moral­ity. Among the rest, I was much di­verted with a lit­tle old trea­tise, which al­ways lay in Glum­dal­clitch’s bed­cham­ber, and be­longed to her gov­erness, a grave el­derly gen­tle­woman, who dealt in writ­ings of moral­ity and de­vo­tion. The book treats of the weak­ness of hu­man kind, and is in lit­tle es­teem ex­cept among the women and the vul­gar. How­ever, I was cu­ri­ous to see what an au­thor of that coun­try could say upon such a sub­ject. This writer went through all the usual top­ics of Eu­ro­pean moral­ists, show­ing how diminu­tive, con­temptible, and help­less an an­i­mal was man in his own na­ture; how un­able to de­fend him­self from the in­clemen­cies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts; how much he was ex­celled by one crea­ture in strength, by an­other in speed, by a third in fore­sight, by a fourth in in­dus­try. He added that na­ture was de­gen­er­ated in these lat­ter de­clin­ing ages of the world, and could now pro­duce only small abortive births in com­par­i­son of those in an­cient times. He said it was very rea­son­able to think, not only that the species of men were orig­i­nally much larger, but also that there must have been gi­ants in for­mer ages, which, as it is as­serted by his­tory and tra­di­tion, so it has been con­firmed by huge bones and skulls ca­su­ally dug up in sev­eral parts of the king­dom, far ex­ceed­ing the com­mon dwin­dled race of man in our days. He ar­gued that the very laws of na­ture ab­so­lutely re­quired we should have been made, in the be­gin­ning, of a size more large and ro­bust, not so li­able to de­struc­tion from ev­ery lit­tle ac­ci­dent of a tile fall­ing from a house or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or of be­ing drowned in a lit­tle brook. From this way of rea­son­ing the au­thor drew sev­eral moral ap­pli­ca­tions, use­ful in the con­duct of life, but need­less here to re­peat. For my own part, I could not avoid re­flect­ing how uni­ver­sally this tal­ent was spread of draw­ing lec­tures in moral­ity, or in­deed rather mat­ter of dis­con­tent and re­pin­ing, from the quar­rels we raise with na­ture. And I be­lieve, upon a strict in­quiry, those quar­rels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that peo­ple."/>

I was car­ried as usual in my trav­el­ing box, which, as I have al­ready de­scribed, was a very con­ve­nient closet of twelve feet wide. And I had or­dered a ham­mock to be fixed by silken ropes from the four cor­ners at the top, to break the jolts when a ser­vant car­ried me be­fore him on horse­back, as I some­times de­sired; and would of­ten sleep in my ham­mock while we were upon the road. On the roof of my closet, not di­rectly over the mid­dle of the ham­mock, I or­dered the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot weather as I slept; which hole I shut at plea­sure with a board that drew back­wards and for­wards through a groove."/>

                <ITEXT CH="When we came to our jour­ney’s end, the king thought proper to pass a few days at a palace he has near Flan­flas­nic, a city within eigh­teen Eng­lish miles of the sea­side. Glum­dal­clitch and I were much fa­tigued; I had got­ten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be con­fined to her cham­ber. I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of my es­cape, if ever it should hap­pen. I pre­tended to be worse than I re­ally was, and de­sired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a page whom I was very fond of, and who had some­times been trusted with me. I shall never for­get with what un­will­ing­ness Glum­dal­clitch con­sented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be care­ful of me, burst­ing at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some fore­bod­ing of what was to hap­pen. The boy took me out in my box, about half an hour’s walk from the palace, to­wards the rocks on the seashore. I or­dered him to set me down, and lift­ing up one of my sashes, cast many a wist­ful melan­choly look to­wards the sea. I found my­self not very well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my ham­mock, which I hoped would do me good. I got in, and the boy shut the win­dow close down to keep out the cold. I soon fell asleep, and all I can con­jec­ture is that while I slept, the page, think­ing no dan­ger could hap­pen, went among the rocks to look for birds’ eggs, hav­ing be­fore ob­served him from my win­dow search­ing about, and pick­ing up one or two in the clefts. Be that as it will, I found my­self sud­denly awak­ened with a vi­o­lent pull upon the ring which was fas­tened at the top of my box for the con­ve­niency of car­riage. I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne for­ward with prodi­gious speed. The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my ham­mock, but af­ter­wards the mo­tion was easy enough. I called out sev­eral times as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no pur­pose. I looked to­wards my win­dows, and could see noth­ing but the clouds and sky. I heard a noise over my head like the clap­ping of wings, and then be­gan to per­ceive the woe­ful con­di­tion I was in; that some ea­gle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an in­tent to let it fall on a rock like a tor­toise in a shell, and then pick out my body and de­vour it: for the sagac­ity and smell of this bird en­able him to dis­cover his quarry at a great dis­tance, though bet­ter con­cealed than I could be within a two-inch board."/>

                <ITEXT CH="In a lit­tle time I ob­served the noise and flut­ter of wings to in­crease very fast, and my box was tossed up and down like a sign­post in a windy day. I heard sev­eral bangs or buf­fets, as I thought, given to the ea­gle (for such I am cer­tain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his beak), and then all on a sud­den felt my­self fall­ing per­pen­dic­u­larly down for above a minute, but with such in­cred­i­ble swift­ness that I al­most lost my breath. My fall was stopped by a ter­ri­ble squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Ni­a­gara; af­ter which, I was quite in the dark for an­other minute, and then my box be­gan to rise so high that I could see light from the tops of my win­dows. I now per­ceived I was fallen into the sea. My box, by the weight of my body, the goods that were in it, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four cor­ners of the top and bot­tom, floated about five feet deep in wa­ter. I did then and do now sup­pose that the ea­gle which flew away with my box was pur­sued by two or three oth­ers, and forced to let me drop while he was de­fend­ing him­self against the rest, who hoped to share in the prey. The plates of iron fas­tened at the bot­tom of the box (for those were the strong­est) pre­served the bal­ance while it fell, and hin­dered it from be­ing bro­ken on the sur­face of the wa­ter. Ev­ery joint of it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very lit­tle wa­ter came in. I got with much dif­fi­culty out of my ham­mock, hav­ing first ven­tured to draw back the slip-board on the roof al­ready men­tioned, con­trived on pur­pose to let in air, for want of which I found my­self al­most sti­fled."/>

                <ITEXT CH="How of­ten did I then wish my­self with my dear Glum­dal­clitch, from whom one sin­gle hour had so far di­vided me! And I may say with truth, that in the midst of my own mis­for­tunes I could not for­bear lament­ing my poor nurse, the grief she would suf­fer for my loss, the dis­plea­sure of the queen, and the ruin of her for­tune. Per­haps many trav­el­ers have not been un­der greater dif­fi­cul­ties and dis­tress than I was at this junc­ture, ex­pect­ing ev­ery mo­ment to see my box dashed in pieces, or at least over­set by the first vi­o­lent blast, or a ris­ing wave. A breach in one sin­gle pane of glass would have been im­me­di­ate death; nor could any­thing have pre­served the win­dows but the strong lat­tice wires placed on the out­side against ac­ci­dents in trav­el­ing. I saw the wa­ter ooze in at sev­eral cran­nies, al­though the leaks were not con­sid­er­able, and I en­deav­ored to stop them as well as I could. I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which oth­er­wise I cer­tainly should have done, and sat on the top of it, where I might at least pre­serve my­self some hours longer than by be­ing shut up, as I may call it, in the hold. Or if I es­caped these dan­gers for a day or two, what could I ex­pect but a mis­er­able death of cold and hunger? I was four hours un­der these cir­cum­stances, ex­pect­ing and in­deed wish­ing ev­ery mo­ment to be my last."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I have al­ready told the reader that there were two strong sta­ples fixed upon that side of my box which had no win­dow, and into which the ser­vant who used to carry me on horse­back would put a leath­ern belt, and buckle it about his waist. Be­ing in this dis­con­so­late state, I heard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grat­ing noise on that side of my box where the sta­ples were fixed, and soon af­ter I be­gan to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along in the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tug­ging which made the waves rise near the tops of my win­dows, leav­ing me al­most in the dark. This gave me some faint hopes of re­lief, al­though I was not able to imag­ine how it could be brought about. I ven­tured to un­screw one of my chairs, which were al­ways fas­tened to the floor; and hav­ing made a hard shift to screw it down again di­rectly un­der the slip­ping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the lan­guages I un­der­stood. I then fas­tened my hand­ker­chief to a stick I usu­ally car­ried, and thrust­ing it up the hole, waved it sev­eral times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near, the sea­men might con­jec­ture some un­happy mor­tal to be shut up in this box."/>

I ap­pre­hended it to be a rock, and found my­self tossed more than ever. I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet, like that of a ca­ble, and the grat­ing of it as it passed through the ring. I then found my­self hoisted up, by de­grees, at least three feet higher than I was be­fore. Where­upon I again thrust up my stick and hand­ker­chief, call­ing for help till I was al­most hoarse. In re­turn to which, I heard a great shout re­peated three times, giv­ing me such trans­ports of joy as are not to be con­ceived but by those who feel them. I now heard a tram­pling over my head, and some­body call­ing through the hole with a loud voice, in the Eng­lish tongue, “If there be any­body be­low let him speak.” I an­swered, I was an En­glish­man, drawn by ill for­tune into the great­est calamity that ever any crea­ture un­der­went, and begged, by all that is mov­ing, to be de­liv­ered out of the dun­geon I was in. The voice replied, I was safe, for my box was fas­tened to their ship; and the car­pen­ter should im­me­di­ately come and saw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull me out. I an­swered, that was need­less, and would take up too much time; for there was no more to be done but let one of the crew put his fin­ger into the ring, and take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the cap­tain’s cabin. Some of them, upon hear­ing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad; oth­ers laughed; for in­deed it never came into my head that I was now among peo­ple of my own stature and strength. The car­pen­ter came, and in a few min­utes sawed a pas­sage about four feet square, then let down a small lad­der, upon which I mounted, and from thence was taken into the ship in a very weak con­di­tion."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The sailors were all in amaze­ment, and asked me a thou­sand ques­tions, which I had no in­cli­na­tion to an­swer. I was equally con­founded at the sight of so many pig­mies, for such I took them to be, af­ter hav­ing so long ac­cus­tomed my eyes to the mon­strous ob­jects I had left. But the cap­tain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an hon­est wor­thy Shrop­shire man, ob­serv­ing I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cor­dial to com­fort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, ad­vis­ing me to take a lit­tle rest, of which I had great need. Be­fore I went to sleep, I gave him to un­der­stand that I had some valu­able fur­ni­ture in my box, too good to be lost: a fine ham­mock, a hand­some field bed, two chairs, a ta­ble, and a cab­i­net; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted, with silk and cot­ton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin, I would open it there be­fore him, and show him my goods. The cap­tain, hear­ing me ut­ter these ab­sur­di­ties, con­cluded I was rav­ing; how­ever (I sup­pose to pacify me), he promised to give or­der as I de­sired, and go­ing upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet, from whence (as I af­ter­wards found), they drew up all my goods, and stripped off the quilt­ing; but the chairs, cab­i­net, and bed­stead, be­ing screwed to the floor, were much dam­aged by the ig­no­rance of the sea­men, who tore them up by force. They then knocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hulk drop into the sea, which, by rea­son of many breaches made in the bot­tom and sides, sunk to rights. And, in­deed, I was glad not to have been a spec­ta­tor of the havoc they made; be­cause I am con­fi­dent it would have sen­si­bly touched me, by bring­ing for­mer pas­sages into my mind which I had rather for­get."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I slept some hours, but per­pet­u­ally dis­turbed with dreams of the place I had left, and the dan­gers I had es­caped. How­ever, upon wak­ing I found my­self much re­cov­ered. It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the cap­tain or­dered sup­per im­me­di­ately, think­ing I had al­ready fasted too long. He en­ter­tained me with great kind­ness, ob­serv­ing me not to look wildly, or talk in­con­sis­tently; and when we were left alone, de­sired I would re­late to him my trav­els, and by what ac­ci­dent I came to be set adrift in that mon­strous wooden chest. He said that about twelve o’clock at noon, as he was look­ing through his glass, he spied it at a dis­tance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make, be­ing not much out of his course, in hopes of buy­ing some bis­cuit, his own be­gin­ning to fall short. That upon com­ing nearer, and find­ing his er­ror, he sent out his long­boat, to dis­cover what I was; that his men came back in a fright, swear­ing they had seen a swim­ming house. That he laughed at their folly, and went him­self in the boat, or­der­ing his men to take a strong ca­ble along with them. That the weather be­ing calm, he rowed round me sev­eral times, ob­served my win­dows and the wire lat­tices that de­fended them. That he dis­cov­ered two sta­ples upon one side, which was all of boards, with­out any pas­sage for light. He then com­manded his men to row up to that side, and fas­ten­ing a ca­ble to one of the sta­ples, or­dered them to tow my chest, as he called it, to­wards the ship. When it was there, he gave di­rec­tions to fas­ten an­other ca­ble to the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise my chest with pul­leys, which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet. He said they saw my stick and hand­ker­chief thrust out of the hole, and con­cluded that some un­happy man must be shut up in the cav­ity. I asked whether he or the crew had seen any prodi­gious birds in the air, about the time he first dis­cov­ered me. To which he an­swered, that dis­cussing this mat­ter with the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said he had ob­served three ea­gles fly­ing to­wards the north, but re­marked noth­ing of their be­ing larger than the usual size, which I sup­pose must be im­puted to the great height they were at; and could not guess the rea­son of my ques­tion. I then asked the cap­tain how far he reck­oned we might be from land. He said, by the best com­pu­ta­tion he could make, we were at least a hun­dred leagues. I as­sured him that he must be mis­taken by al­most half, for I had not left the coun­try whence I came above two hours be­fore I dropped into the sea. Where­upon he be­gan again to think my brain was dis­turbed, of which he gave me a hint, and ad­vised me to go to bed in a cabin he had pro­vided. I as­sured him I was well re­freshed with his good en­ter­tain­ment and com­pany, and as much in my senses as ever I was in my life. He then grew se­ri­ous, and de­sired to ask me freely whether I were not trou­bled in mind by the con­scious­ness of some enor­mous crime, for which I was pun­ished at the com­mand of some prince, by ex­pos­ing me in that chest; as great crim­i­nals in other coun­tries have been forced to sea in a leaky ves­sel, with­out pro­vi­sions; for al­though he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would en­gage his word to set me safe on shore, in the first port where we ar­rived. He added, that his sus­pi­cions were much in­creased by some very ab­surd speeches I had de­liv­ered at first to the sailors, and af­ter­wards to him­self, in re­la­tion to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks and be­hav­ior while I was at sup­per."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I begged his pa­tience to hear me tell my story, which I faith­fully did, from the last time I left Eng­land to the mo­ment he first dis­cov­ered me. And as truth al­ways forces its way into ra­tio­nal minds, so this hon­est wor­thy gen­tle­man, who had some tinc­ture of learn­ing, and very good sense, was im­me­di­ately con­vinced of my can­dor and ve­rac­ity. But, fur­ther to con­firm all I had said, I en­treated him to give or­der that my cab­i­net be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had al­ready in­formed me how the sea­men dis­posed of my closet. I opened it in his pres­ence, and showed him the small col­lec­tion of rar­i­ties I made in the coun­try from whence I had been so strangely de­liv­ered. There was the comb I had con­trived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and an­other of the same ma­te­rial, but fixed into a par­ing of her majesty’s thumb nail, which served for the back. There was a col­lec­tion of nee­dles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings like join­ers’ tacks; some comb­ings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring which one day she made me a present of in a most oblig­ing man­ner, tak­ing it from her lit­tle fin­ger and throw­ing it over my head like a col­lar. I de­sired the cap­tain would please to ac­cept this ring in re­turn of his ci­vil­i­ties; which he ab­so­lutely re­fused. Lastly, I de­sired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a mouse’s skin."/>

                <ITEXT CH="He said he won­dered at one thing very much, which was to hear me speak so loud; ask­ing me whether the king and queen of that coun­try were thick of hear­ing. I told him it was what I had been used to for above two years past, and that I ad­mired as much at the voices of him and his men, who seemed to me only to whis­per, and yet I could hear them well enough. But when I spoke in that coun­try, it was like a man talk­ing in the street to an­other look­ing out from the top of a steeple, un­less when I was placed on a ta­ble, or held in any per­son’s hand. I told him, I had like­wise ob­served an­other thing, that when I first got into the ship, and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most con­temptible lit­tle crea­tures I had ever be­held. For, in­deed, while I was in that prince’s coun­try, I could never en­dure to look in a glass af­ter my eyes had been ac­cus­tomed to such prodi­gious ob­jects, be­cause the com­par­i­son gave me so de­spi­ca­ble a con­ceit of my­self. The cap­tain said that while we were at sup­per he ob­served me to look at ev­ery­thing with a sort of won­der, and that I of­ten seemed hardly able to con­tain my laugh­ter, which he knew not well how to take, but im­puted it to some dis­or­der in my brain. I an­swered, it was very true; and I won­dered how I could for­bear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a sil­ver three­pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouth­ful, a cup not so big as a nut­shell; and so I went on, de­scrib­ing the rest of his house­hold stuff and pro­vi­sions af­ter the same man­ner. For, al­though the queen had or­dered a lit­tle equipage of all things nec­es­sary for me, while I was in her ser­vice, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on ev­ery side of me, and I winked at my own lit­tle­ness as peo­ple do at their own faults. The cap­tain un­der­stood my raillery very well, and mer­rily replied with the old Eng­lish proverb, that he doubted my eyes were big­ger than my belly, for he did not ob­serve my stom­ach so good, al­though I had fasted all day; and con­tin­u­ing in his mirth, protested he would have gladly given a hun­dred pounds to have seen my closet in the ea­gle’s bill, and af­ter­wards in its fall from so great a height into the sea; which would cer­tainly have been a most as­ton­ish­ing ob­ject, wor­thy to have the de­scrip­tion of it trans­mit­ted to fu­ture ages; and the com­par­i­son of Phaëthon was so ob­vi­ous that he could not for­bear ap­ply­ing it, al­though I did not much ad­mire the con­ceit."/>

Our voy­age was very pros­per­ous, but I shall not trou­ble the reader with a jour­nal of it. The cap­tain called in at one or two ports, and sent in his long­boat for pro­vi­sions and fresh wa­ter; but I never went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third day of June, 1706, about nine months af­ter my es­cape. I of­fered to leave my goods in se­cu­rity for pay­ment of my freight, but the cap­tain protested he would not re­ceive one far­thing.

I en­com­passed it al­most round be­fore I could find a con­ve­nient place to land in; which was a small creek, about three times the wide­ness of my ca­noe. I found the is­land to be all rocky, only a lit­tle in­ter­min­gled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling herbs. I took out my small pro­vi­sions, and af­ter hav­ing re­freshed my­self, I se­cured the re­main­der in a cave, whereof there were great num­bers; I gath­ered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quan­tity of dry sea­weed and parched grass, which I de­signed to kin­dle the next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel, match, and burn­ing-glass. I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my pro­vi­sions. My bed was the same dry grass and sea­weed which I in­tended for fuel. I slept very lit­tle, for the dis­qui­ets of my mind pre­vailed over my weari­ness, and kept me awake. I con­sid­ered how im­pos­si­ble it was to pre­serve my life in so des­o­late a place, and how mis­er­able my end must be: yet I found my­self so list­less and de­spond­ing, that I had not the heart to rise; and be­fore I could get spir­its enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far ad­vanced. I walked awhile among the rocks; the sky was per­fectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it; when all on a sud­den it be­came ob­scured, as I thought, in a man­ner very dif­fer­ent from what hap­pens by the in­ter­po­si­tion of a cloud. I turned back, and per­ceived a vast opaque body be­tween me and the sun, mov­ing for­wards to­wards the is­land; it seemed to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven min­utes; but I did not ob­serve the air to be much colder, or the sky more dark­ened, than if I had stood un­der the shade of a moun­tain. As it ap­proached nearer over the place where I was, it ap­peared to me a firm sub­stance, the bot­tom flat, smooth, and shin­ing very bright from the re­flec­tion of the sea be­low. I stood upon a height about two hun­dred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body de­scend­ing al­most to a par­al­lel with me, at less than an Eng­lish mile dis­tance.

But at the same time, the reader can hardly con­ceive my as­ton­ish­ment, to be­hold an is­land in the air, in­hab­ited by men, who were able (as it should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into a pro­gres­sive mo­tion, as they pleased. But not be­ing at that time in a dis­po­si­tion to phi­los­o­phize upon this phe­nom­e­non, I rather chose to ob­serve what course the is­land would take, be­cause it seemed for awhile to stand still. Yet soon af­ter, it ad­vanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it en­com­passed with sev­eral gra­da­tions of gal­leries, and stairs at cer­tain in­ter­vals to de­scend from one to the other. In the low­est gallery, I be­held some peo­ple fish­ing with long an­gling rods, and oth­ers look­ing on. I waved my cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my hand­ker­chief to­wards the is­land; and upon its nearer ap­proach, I called and shouted with the ut­most strength of my voice; and then look­ing cir­cum­spectly, I be­held a crowd gath­ered to that side which was most in my view. I found by their point­ing to­wards me and to each other, that they plainly dis­cov­ered me, al­though they made no re­turn to my shout­ing. But I could see four or five men run­ning in great haste up the stairs to the top of the is­land, who then dis­ap­peared. I hap­pened rightly to con­jec­ture that these were sent for or­ders to some per­son in au­thor­ity upon this oc­ca­sion."/>

I then put my­self in the most sup­pli­cat­ing pos­tures, and spoke in the hum­blest ac­cent, but re­ceived no an­swer. Those who stood near­est over against me, seemed to be per­sons of dis­tinc­tion, as I sup­posed by their habit. They con­ferred earnestly with each other, look­ing of­ten upon me.

There stood by him on each side a young page, with flaps in their hands, and when they saw he was at leisure, one of them gen­tly struck his mouth, and the other his right ear; at which he started like one awaked on the sud­den, and look­ing to­wards me and the com­pany I was in, rec­ol­lected the oc­ca­sion of our com­ing, whereof he had been in­formed be­fore. He spoke some words, where­upon im­me­di­ately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and flapped me gen­tly on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no oc­ca­sion for such an in­stru­ment; which, as I af­ter­wards found, gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opin­ion of my un­der­stand­ing. The king, as far as I could con­jec­ture, asked me sev­eral ques­tions, and I ad­dressed my­self to him in all the lan­guages I had. When it was found that I could nei­ther un­der­stand nor be un­der­stood, I was con­ducted by the king’s or­der to an apart­ment in his palace (this prince be­ing dis­tin­guished above all his pre­de­ces­sors for his hos­pi­tal­ity to strangers), where two ser­vants were ap­pointed to at­tend me. My din­ner was brought, and four per­sons of qual­ity, whom I re­mem­bered to have seen very near the king’s per­son, did me the honor to dine with me. We had two cour­ses of three dishes each. In the first course, there was a shoul­der of mut­ton cut into an equi­lat­eral tri­an­gle, a piece of beef into a rhom­boid, and a pud­ding into a cy­cloid. The sec­ond course was two ducks trussed up in the form of fid­dles; sausages and pud­dings re­sem­bling flutes and haut­boys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp. The ser­vants cut our bread into cones, cylin­ders, par­al­lel­o­grams, and sev­eral other math­e­mat­i­cal fig­ures."/>

His majesty had given or­ders that the is­land should move north­east-and-by-east to the ver­ti­cal point over La­gado, the me­trop­o­lis of the whole king­dom be­low, upon the firm earth. It was about ninety leagues dis­tant, and our voy­age lasted four days and a half. I was not in the least sen­si­ble of the pro­gres­sive mo­tion made in the air by the is­land. On the sec­ond morn­ing, about eleven o’clock, the king him­self in per­son, at­tended by his no­bil­ity, courtiers, and of­fi­cers, hav­ing pre­pared all their mu­si­cal in­stru­ments, played on them for three hours with­out in­ter­mis­sion, so that I was quite stunned with the noise; nei­ther could I pos­si­bly guess the mean­ing till my tu­tor in­formed me. He said that the peo­ple of their is­land had their ears adapted to hear the mu­sic of the spheres, which al­ways played at cer­tain pe­ri­ods, and the court was now pre­pared to bear their part, in what­ever in­stru­ment they most ex­celled."/>

                <ITEXT CH="In our jour­ney to­wards La­gado, the cap­i­tal city, his majesty or­dered that the is­land should stop over cer­tain towns and vil­lages, whence he might re­ceive the pe­ti­tions of his sub­jects. And to this pur­pose sev­eral pack­threads were let down, with small weights at the bot­tom. On these pack­threads the peo­ple strung their pe­ti­tions, which mounted up di­rectly, like the scraps of pa­per fas­tened by school­boys at the end of the string that holds their kite. Some­times we re­ceived wine and vict­uals from be­low, which were drawn up by pul­leys."/>

Their ideas are per­pet­u­ally con­ver­sant in lines and fig­ures. If they would, for ex­am­ple, praise the beauty of a woman or any other an­i­mal, they de­scribe it by rhombs, cir­cles, par­al­lel­o­grams, el­lipses, and other ge­o­met­ri­cal terms, or by words of art drawn from mu­sic, need­less here to re­peat.

For if, in its per­i­he­lion, it should ap­proach within a cer­tain de­gree of the sun (as by their cal­cu­la­tions they have rea­son to dread), it will con­ceive a de­gree of heat ten thou­sand times more in­tense than that of red-hot glow­ing iron; and, in its ab­sence from the sun, carry a blaz­ing tail ten hun­dred thou­sand and four­teen miles long, through which if the earth should pass at the dis­tance of one hun­dred thou­sand miles from the nu­cleus or main body of the comet, it must in its pas­sage be set on fire, and re­duced to ashes; that the sun, daily spend­ing its rays with­out any nu­tri­ment to sup­ply them, will at last be wholly con­sumed and an­ni­hi­lated; which must be at­tended with the de­struc­tion of this earth, and of all the plan­ets that re­ceive their light from it."/>

But when we re­turned to his palace, he asked me how I liked the build­ing, what ab­sur­di­ties I ob­served, and what quar­rel I had with the dress and looks of his do­mes­tics.

Af­ter salu­ta­tion, ob­serv­ing me to look earnestly upon a frame, which took up the great­est part of both the length and breadth of the room, he said per­haps I might won­der to see him em­ployed in a project for im­prov­ing spec­u­la­tive knowl­edge by prac­ti­cal and me­chan­i­cal op­er­a­tions. But the world would soon be sen­si­ble of its use­ful­ness, and he flat­tered him­self that a more no­ble ex­alted thought never sprang in any other man’s head. Ev­ery one knew how la­bo­ri­ous the usual method is of at­tain­ing to arts and sci­ences; whereas by his con­trivance the most ig­no­rant per­son, at a rea­son­able charge, and with a lit­tle bod­ily la­bor, may write books in phi­los­o­phy, po­etry, pol­i­tics, law, math­e­mat­ics, and the­ol­ogy, with­out the least as­sis­tance from ge­nius or study. He then led me to the frame, about the sides whereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet square, placed in the mid­dle of the room. The su­per­fi­cies was com­posed of sev­eral bits of wood, about the big­ness of a die, but some larger than oth­ers. They were all linked to­gether by slen­der wires. These bits of wood were cov­ered on ev­ery square with pa­per pasted on them; and on these pa­pers were writ­ten all the words of their lan­guage in their sev­eral moods, tenses, and de­clen­sions, but with­out any or­der. The pro­fes­sor then de­sired me to ob­serve, for he was go­ing to set his en­gine at work. The pupils, at his com­mand, took each of them hold of an iron han­dle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame, and giv­ing them a sud­den turn, the whole dis­po­si­tion of the words was en­tirely changed. He then com­manded six-and-thirty of the lads to read the sev­eral lines softly as they ap­peared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words to­gether that might make part of a sen­tence, they dic­tated to the four re­main­ing boys, who were scribes. This work was re­peated three or four times; and at ev­ery turn the en­gine was so con­trived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved up­side down."/>

An ex­pe­di­ent was there­fore of­fered, that since words are only names for things, it would be more con­ve­nient for all men to carry about them such things as were nec­es­sary to ex­press the par­tic­u­lar busi­ness they are to dis­course on. And this in­ven­tion would cer­tainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as health of the sub­ject, if the women, in con­junc­tion with the vul­gar and il­lit­er­ate, had not threat­ened to raise a re­bel­lion un­less they might be al­lowed the lib­erty to speak with their tongues, af­ter the man­ner of their an­ces­tors; such con­stant ir­rec­on­cil­able en­e­mies to sci­ence are the com­mon peo­ple.

The sec­ond was of an opin­ion di­rectly con­trary: to tax those qual­i­ties of body and mind for which men chiefly value them­selves, the rate to be more or less ac­cord­ing to the de­grees of ex­celling, the de­ci­sion whereof should be left en­tirely to their own breast. The high­est tax was upon men who are the great­est fa­vorites of the other sex, and the as­sess­ments ac­cord­ing to the num­ber and na­tures of the fa­vors they have re­ceived; for which they are al­lowed to be their own vouch­ers. Wit, valor, and po­lite­ness were like­wise pro­posed to be largely taxed, and col­lected in the same man­ner, by ev­ery per­son’s giv­ing his own word for the quan­tum of what he pos­sessed.

                <ITEXT CH="When we ar­rived at the is­land, which was about eleven in the morn­ing, one of the gen­tle­men who ac­com­pa­nied me went to the gov­er­nor and de­sired ad­mit­tance for a stranger, who came on pur­pose to have the honor of at­tend­ing on his high­ness. This was im­me­di­ately granted, and we all three en­tered the gate of the palace be­tween two rows of guards, armed and dressed af­ter a very an­tic man­ner, and some­thing in their coun­te­nances that made my flesh creep with a hor­ror I can­not ex­press. We passed through sev­eral apart­ments, be­tween ser­vants of the same sort, ranked on each side as be­fore, till we came to the cham­ber of pres­ence, where af­ter three pro­found obei­sances and a few gen­eral ques­tions, we were per­mit­ted to sit on three stools near the low­est step of his high­ness’s throne. He un­der­stood the lan­guage of Bal­ni­barbi, al­though it were dif­fer­ent from that of this is­land. He de­sired me to give him some ac­count of my trav­els; and to let me see that I should be treated with­out cer­e­mony, he dis­missed all his at­ten­dants with a turn of his fin­ger; at which, to my great as­ton­ish­ment, they van­ished in an in­stant, like vi­sions in a dream when we awake on a sud­den. I could not re­cover my­self in some time, till the gov­er­nor as­sured me that I should re­ceive no hurt; and ob­serv­ing my two com­pan­ions to be un­der no con­cern, who had been of­ten en­ter­tained in the same man­ner, I be­gan to take courage, and re­lated to his high­ness a short his­tory of my sev­eral ad­ven­tures, yet not with­out some hes­i­ta­tion, and fre­quently look­ing be­hind me to the place where I had seen those do­mes­tic specters. I had the honor to dine with the gov­er­nor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at ta­ble. I now ob­served my­self to be less ter­ri­fied than I had been in the morn­ing. I stayed till sun­set, but humbly de­sired his high­ness to ex­cuse me for not ac­cept­ing his in­vi­ta­tion of lodg­ing in the palace. My two friends and I lay at a pri­vate house in the town ad­join­ing, which is the cap­i­tal of this lit­tle is­land; and the next morn­ing we re­turned to pay our duty to the gov­er­nor, as he was pleased to com­mand us."/>

I pro­posed that Homer and Aris­to­tle might ap­pear at the head of all their com­men­ta­tors; but these were so nu­mer­ous that some hun­dreds were forced to at­tend in the court and out­ward rooms of the palace. I knew and could dis­tin­guish those two he­roes at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other. Homer was the taller and come­lier per­son of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and pierc­ing I ever be­held. Aris­to­tle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His vis­age was mea­ger, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hol­low. I soon dis­cov­ered that both of them were per­fect strangers to the rest of the com­pany, and had never seen or heard of them be­fore. And I had a whis­per from a ghost, who shall be name­less, that these com­men­ta­tors al­ways kept in the most dis­tant quar­ters from their prin­ci­pals, in the lower world, through a con­scious­ness of shame and guilt, be­cause they had so hor­ri­bly mis­rep­re­sented the mean­ing of those au­thors to pos­ter­ity. I in­tro­duced Didy­mus and Eu­stathius to Homer, and pre­vailed on him to treat them bet­ter than per­haps they de­served, for he soon found they wanted a ge­nius to en­ter into the spirit of a poet. But Aris­to­tle was out of all pa­tience with the ac­count I gave him of Sco­tus and Ra­mus, as I pre­sented them to him, and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as them­selves."/>

He pre­dicted the same fate to at­trac­tion, whereof the present learned are such zeal­ous as­ser­tors. He said that new sys­tems of na­ture were but new fash­ions which would vary in ev­ery age; and even those who pre­tend to demon­strate them from math­e­mat­i­cal prin­ci­ples, would flour­ish but a short pe­riod of time, and be out of vogue when that was de­ter­mined."/>

Per­jury, op­pres­sion, sub­or­na­tion, fraud, pan­derism, and the like in­fir­mi­ties, were among the most ex­cus­able arts they had to men­tion; and for these I gave, as it was rea­son­able, great al­lowance.

We cast an­chor within a league of the town, and made a sig­nal for a pi­lot. Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by whom we were guided be­tween cer­tain shoals and rocks which are very dan­ger­ous in the pas­sage to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in safety within a ca­ble’s length of the town wall."/>

I gave him a short ac­count of some par­tic­u­lars, and made my story as plau­si­ble and con­sis­tent as I could; but I thought it nec­es­sary to dis­guise my coun­try, and call my­self a Hol­lan­der, be­cause my in­ten­tions were for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Eu­ro­peans per­mit­ted to en­ter into that king­dom.

The of­fi­cer said I must be con­fined till he could re­ceive or­ders from court, for which he would write im­me­di­ately, and hoped to re­ceive an an­swer in a fort­night.

All my ret­inue was that poor lad for an in­ter­preter, whom I per­suaded into my ser­vice, and at my hum­ble re­quest, we had each of us a mule to ride on. A mes­sen­ger was dis­patched half a day’s jour­ney be­fore us, to give the king no­tice of my ap­proach; and to de­sire that his majesty would please to ap­point a day and hour, when it would be his gra­cious plea­sure that I might have the honor to lick the dust be­fore his foot­stool. This is the court style, and I found it to be more than mat­ter of form: for, upon my ad­mit­tance two days af­ter my ar­rival, I was com­manded to crawl on my belly, and lick the floor as I ad­vanced; but on ac­count of my be­ing a stranger, care was taken to have it swept so clean that the dust was not of­fen­sive. How­ever, this was a pe­cu­liar grace, not al­lowed to any but per­sons of the high­est rank, when they de­sire an ad­mit­tance. Nay, some­times the floor is strewed with dust on pur­pose, when the per­son to be ad­mit­ted hap­pens to have pow­er­ful en­e­mies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper dis­tance from the throne, he was not able to speak a word. Nei­ther is there any rem­edy, be­cause it is cap­i­tal for those who re­ceive an au­di­ence to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty’s pres­ence. There is in­deed an­other cus­tom which I can­not al­to­gether ap­prove of: When the king has a mind to put any of his no­bles to death in a gen­tle in­dul­gent man­ner, he com­mands to have the floor strewn with a cer­tain brown pow­der of a deadly com­po­si­tion, which, be­ing licked up, in­fal­li­bly kills him in twenty-four hours. But in jus­tice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his sub­jects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the mon­archs of Eu­rope would im­i­tate him), it must be men­tioned for his honor, that strict or­ders are given to have the in­fected parts of the floor well washed af­ter ev­ery such ex­e­cu­tion, which if his do­mes­tics ne­glect, they are in dan­ger of in­cur­ring his royal dis­plea­sure. I my­self heard him give di­rec­tions that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give no­tice about wash­ing the floor af­ter an ex­e­cu­tion, but ma­li­ciously had omit­ted it, by which ne­glect a young lord of great hopes, com­ing to an au­di­ence, was un­for­tu­nately poi­soned, al­though the king at that time had no de­sign against his life. But this good prince was so gra­cious as to for­give the poor page his whip­ping, upon prom­ise that he would do so no more, with­out spe­cial or­ders."/>

He said they com­monly acted like mor­tals till about thirty years old; af­ter which, by de­grees, they grew melan­choly and de­jected, in­creas­ing in both till they came to fourscore. This he learned from their own con­fes­sion; for oth­er­wise, there not be­ing above two or three of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a gen­eral ob­ser­va­tion by. When they came to fourscore years, which is reck­oned the ex­trem­ity of liv­ing in this coun­try, they had not only all the fol­lies and in­fir­mi­ties of other old men, but many more which arose from the dread­ful prospect of never dy­ing. They were not only opin­ion­a­tive, peev­ish, cov­etous, mo­rose, vain, talk­a­tive, but in­ca­pable of friend­ship, and dead to all nat­u­ral af­fec­tion, which never de­scended be­low their grand­chil­dren. Envy and im­po­tent de­sires are their pre­vail­ing pas­sions. But those ob­jects against which their envy seems prin­ci­pally di­rected, are the vices of the younger sort, and the deaths of the old. By re­flect­ing on the for­mer, they find them­selves cut off from all pos­si­bil­ity of plea­sure; and when­ever they see a fu­neral they lament and re­pine that oth­ers are gone to a har­bor of rest, to which they them­selves never can hope to ar­rive. They have no re­mem­brance of any­thing but what they learned and ob­served in their youth and mid­dle age, and even that is very im­per­fect; and for the truth or par­tic­u­lars of any fact it is safer to de­pend on com­mon tra­di­tions than upon their best rec­ol­lec­tions. The least mis­er­able among them ap­pear to be those who turn to dotage, and en­tirely lose their mem­o­ries; these meet with more pity and as­sis­tance, be­cause they want many bad qual­i­ties which abound in oth­ers."/>

                <ITEXT CH="On the sixth of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty and all my friends. This prince was so gra­cious as to or­der a guard to con­duct me to Glanguen­stald, which is a royal port to the south­west part of the is­land. In six days I found a ves­sel ready to carry me to Japan, and spent fif­teen days in the voy­age. We landed at a small port town called Xam­oschi, sit­u­ated on the south­east part of Japan; the town lies on the west­ern point, where there is a nar­row strait lead­ing north­ward into a long arm of the sea, upon the north­west part of which Yedo, the me­trop­o­lis, stands. At land­ing I showed the cus­tom­house of­fi­cers my let­ter from the king of Lug­gnagg to his im­pe­rial majesty. They knew the seal per­fectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand. The im­pres­sion was a king lift­ing up a lame beg­gar from the earth. The mag­is­trates of the town, hear­ing of my let­ter, re­ceived me as a pub­lic min­is­ter; they pro­vided me with car­riages and ser­vants, and bore my charges to Yedo, where I was ad­mit­ted to an au­di­ence, and de­liv­ered my let­ter, which was opened with great cer­e­mony, and ex­plained to the em­peror by an in­ter­preter, who then gave me no­tice, by his majesty’s or­der, that I should sig­nify my re­quest, and what­ever it were, it should be granted for the sake of his royal brother of Lug­gnagg. This in­ter­preter was a per­son em­ployed to trans­act af­fairs with the Hol­lan­ders; he soon con­jec­tured by my coun­te­nance, that I was a Eu­ro­pean, and there­fore re­peated his majesty’s com­mands in Low Dutch, which he spoke per­fectly well. I an­swered, as I had be­fore de­ter­mined, that I was a Dutch mer­chant, ship­wrecked in a re­mote coun­try, whence I trav­eled by sea and land to Lug­gnagg, and then took ship­ping for Japan, where I knew my coun­try­men of­ten traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an op­por­tu­nity of re­turn­ing into Eu­rope. I there­fore most humbly en­treated his royal fa­vor, to give or­der that I should be con­ducted in safety to Nan­gasac. To this I added an­other pe­ti­tion, that for the sake of my pa­tron the king of Lug­gnagg his majesty would con­de­scend to ex­cuse my per­form­ing the cer­e­mony im­posed on my coun­try­men of tram­pling upon the cru­ci­fix, be­cause I had been thrown into his king­dom by my mis­for­tunes, with­out any in­ten­tion of trad­ing. When this lat­ter pe­ti­tion was in­ter­preted to the em­peror, he seemed a lit­tle sur­prised, and said he be­lieved I was the first of my coun­try­men who ever made any scru­ple in this point, and that he be­gan to doubt whether I was a real Hol­lan­der or no; but rather sus­pected that I must be a Chris­tian. How­ever, for the rea­sons I had of­fered, but chiefly to grat­ify the king of Lug­gnagg by an un­com­mon mark of his fa­vor, he would com­ply with the sin­gu­lar­ity of my hu­mor; but the af­fair must be man­aged with dex­ter­ity, and his of­fi­cers should be com­manded to let me pass as it were by for­get­ful­ness; for he as­sured me that if the se­cret should be dis­cov­ered by my coun­try­men, the Dutch, they would cut my throat on the voy­age. I re­turned my thanks, by the in­ter­preter, for so un­usual a fa­vor; and some troops be­ing at that time on the march to Nan­gasac, the com­mand­ing of­fi­cer had or­ders to con­vey me safe thither, with par­tic­u­lar in­struc­tions about the busi­ness of the cru­ci­fix."/>

                <ITEXT CH="On the 9th day of June, 1709, I ar­rived at Nan­gasac, af­ter a very long and trou­ble­some jour­ney. I soon fell into com­pany of some Dutch sailors be­long­ing to the Am­boyna of Am­s­ter­dam, a stout ship of 450 tons. I had lived long in Hol­land, pur­su­ing my stud­ies at Ley­den, and I spoke Dutch well. The sea­men soon knew whence I came last; they were cu­ri­ous to in­quire into my voy­ages and course of life. I made up a story as short and prob­a­ble as I could, but con­cealed the great­est part. I knew many per­sons in Hol­land; I was able to in­vent names for my par­ents, whom I pre­tended to be ob­scure peo­ple in the prov­ince of Gelder­land. I would have given the cap­tain (one Theodorus Van­grult) what he pleased to ask for my voy­age to Hol­land; but un­der­stand­ing I was a sur­geon, he was con­tented to take half the usual rate, on con­di­tion that I would serve him in the way of my call­ing. Be­fore we took ship, I was of­ten asked by some of the crew whether I had per­formed the cer­e­mony above men­tioned. I evaded the ques­tion by gen­eral an­swers that I had sat­is­fied the em­peror and court in all par­tic­u­lars. How­ever, a ma­li­cious rogue of a skip­per went to an of­fi­cer, and point­ing to me, told him I had not yet tram­pled on the cru­ci­fix; but the other, who had re­ceived in­struc­tions to let me pass, gave the ras­cal twenty strokes on the shoul­ders with a bam­boo; af­ter which I was no more trou­bled with such ques­tions."/>

He was an hon­est man, and a good sailor, but a lit­tle too pos­i­tive in his own opin­ions; which was the cause of his de­struc­tion, as it has been of sev­eral oth­ers: for if he had fol­lowed my ad­vice, he might have been safe at home with his fam­ily at this time as well as my­self."/>

                <ITEXT CH="I had sev­eral men died in my ship of ca­len­tures, so that I was forced to get re­cruits out of Bar­ba­does and the Lee­ward Is­lands, where I touched by the di­rec­tion of the mer­chants who em­ployed me; which I had soon too much cause to re­pent; for I found af­ter­wards that most of them had been buc­ca­neers. I had fifty hands on board, and my or­ders were, that I should trade with the In­di­ans in the South Sea, and make what dis­cov­er­ies I could. These rogues whom I had picked up de­bauched my other men, and they all formed a con­spir­acy to seize the ship and se­cure me; which they did one morn­ing, rush­ing into my cabin, and bind­ing me hand and foot, threat­en­ing to throw me over­board if I of­fered to stir. I told them I was their pris­oner and would sub­mit. This they made me swear to do, and then they un­bound me, only fas­ten­ing one of my legs with a chain, near my bed, and placed a sen­try at my door with his piece charged, who was com­manded to shoot me dead, if I at­tempted my lib­erty. They sent me down vict­uals and drink, and took the gov­ern­ment of the ship to them­selves. Their de­sign was to turn pi­rates, and plun­der the Spaniards, which they could not do till they got more men. But first they re­solved to sell the goods in the ship, and then go to Mada­gas­car for re­cruits, sev­eral among them hav­ing died since my con­fine­ment. They sailed many weeks, and traded with the In­di­ans; but I knew not what course they took, be­ing kept a close pris­oner in my cabin, and ex­pect­ing noth­ing less than to be mur­dered, as they of­ten threat­ened me."/>

                <ITEXT CH="Upon the 9th of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin, and said he had or­ders from the cap­tain to set me ashore. I ex­pos­tu­lated with him, but in vain; nei­ther would he so much as tell me who their new cap­tain was. They forced me into the long­boat, let­ting me put on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bun­dle of linen, but no arms ex­cept my hanger; and they were so civil as not to search my pock­ets, into which I con­veyed what money I had, with some other lit­tle nec­es­saries. They rowed about a league, and then set me down on a strand. I de­sired them to tell me what coun­try it was. They all swore they knew no more than my­self, but said that the cap­tain (as they called him) was re­solved, af­ter they had sold the lad­ing, to get rid of me in the first place where they could dis­cover land. They pushed off im­me­di­ately, ad­vis­ing me to make haste for fear of be­ing over­taken by the tide, and so bade me farewell."/>

                <ITEXT CH="In this des­o­late con­di­tion I ad­vanced, and soon got upon firm ground, where I sat down on a bank to rest my­self, and con­sider what I had best to do. When I was a lit­tle re­freshed, I went up into the coun­try, re­solv­ing to de­liver my­self to the first sav­ages I should meet, and pur­chase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other toys which sailors usu­ally pro­vide them­selves with in those voy­ages, and whereof I had some about me. The land was di­vided by long rows of trees, not reg­u­larly planted, but nat­u­rally grow­ing; there was great plenty of grass, and sev­eral fields of oats. I walked very cir­cum­spectly, for fear of be­ing sur­prised, or sud­denly shot with an ar­row from be­hind or on ei­ther side. I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracks of hu­man feet, and some of cows, but most of horses. At last I be­held sev­eral an­i­mals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sit­ting in trees. Their shape was very sin­gu­lar and de­formed, which a lit­tle dis­com­posed me, so that I lay down be­hind a thicket to ob­serve them bet­ter. Some of them com­ing for­ward near the place where I lay, gave me an op­por­tu­nity of dis­tinctly mark­ing their form. Their heads and breasts were cov­ered with a thick hair, some friz­zled and oth­ers lank; they had beards like goats, and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the foreparts of their legs and feet; but the rest of their bod­ies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff color. They had no tails, and used the sit­ting pos­ture, as well as ly­ing down, and of­ten stood on their hind feet. They climbed high trees as nim­bly as a squir­rel, for they had strong ex­tended claws be­fore and be­hind, ter­mi­nat­ing in sharp points, and hooked. They would of­ten spring, and bound, and leap, with prodi­gious agility. The fe­males were not so large as the males; they had long lank hair on their backs, but none on their faces, nor any­thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their bod­ies. The hair of both sexes was of sev­eral col­ors, brown, red, black, and yel­low. Upon the whole I never be­held in all my trav­els so dis­agree­able an an­i­mal, nor one against which I nat­u­rally con­ceived so strong an an­tipa­thy; so that think­ing I had seen enough, full of con­tempt and aver­sion, I got up, and pur­sued the beaten road, hop­ing it might di­rect me to the cabin of some In­dian. I had not gone far when I met one of these crea­tures full in my way, and com­ing up di­rectly to me. The ugly mon­ster, when he saw me, dis­torted sev­eral ways ev­ery fea­ture of his vis­age, and stared as at an ob­ject he had never seen be­fore; then ap­proach­ing nearer, lifted up his forepaw, whether out of cu­rios­ity or mis­chief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike him with the edge, fear­ing the in­hab­i­tants might be pro­voked against me, if they should come to know that I had killed or maimed any of their cat­tle. When the beast felt the smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty came flock­ing about me from the next field, howl­ing and mak­ing odi­ous faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and lean­ing my back against it, kept them off by wav­ing my hanger."/>

                <ITEXT CH="In the midst of this dis­tress, I ob­served all to run away on a sud­den as fast as they could; at which I ven­tured to leave the tree and pur­sue the road, won­der­ing what it was that could put them into this fright. But look­ing on my left hand I saw a horse walk­ing softly in the field; which my per­se­cu­tors hav­ing sooner dis­cov­ered, was the cause of their flight. The horse started a lit­tle when he came near me, but soon re­cov­er­ing him­self, looked full in my face with man­i­fest to­kens of won­der. He viewed my hands and feet, walk­ing round me sev­eral times. I would have pur­sued my jour­ney, but he placed him­self di­rectly in the way, yet look­ing with a very mild as­pect, never of­fer­ing the least vi­o­lence. We stood gaz­ing at each other for some time; at last I took the bold­ness to reach my hand to­wards his neck with a de­sign to stroke it, us­ing the com­mon style and whis­tle of jock­eys when they are go­ing to han­dle a strange horse. But this an­i­mal seem­ing to re­ceive my ci­vil­i­ties with dis­dain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly rais­ing up his right fore­foot to re­move my hand. Then he neighed three or four times, but in so dif­fer­ent a ca­dence, that I al­most be­gan to think he was speak­ing to him­self in some lan­guage of his own."/>

                <ITEXT CH="While he and I were thus em­ployed, an­other horse came up; who ap­ply­ing him­self to the first in a very for­mal man­ner, they gen­tly struck each other’s right hoof be­fore, neigh­ing sev­eral times by turns, and vary­ing the sound, which seemed to be al­most ar­tic­u­late. They went some paces off, as if it were to con­fer to­gether, walk­ing side by side, back­wards and for­wards, like per­sons de­lib­er­at­ing upon some af­fair of weight, but of­ten turn­ing their eyes to­wards me, as it were to watch that I might not es­cape. I was amazed to see such ac­tions and be­hav­ior in brute beasts; and con­cluded with my­self, that if the in­hab­i­tants of this coun­try were in­dued with a pro­por­tion­able de­gree of rea­son, they must needs be the wis­est peo­ple upon earth. This thought gave me so much com­fort, that I re­solved to go for­ward un­til I could dis­cover some house or vil­lage, or meet with any of the na­tives, leav­ing the two horses to dis­course to­gether as they pleased. But the first, who was a dap­ple gray, ob­serv­ing me to steal off, neighed af­ter me in so ex­pres­sive a tone, that I fan­cied my­self to un­der­stand what he meant; where­upon I turned back, and came near him, to ex­pect his far­ther com­mands, but con­ceal­ing my fear as much as I could; for I be­gan to be in some pain how this ad­ven­ture might ter­mi­nate; and the reader will eas­ily be­lieve I did not much like my present sit­u­a­tion."/>

                <ITEXT CH="The two horses came up close to me, look­ing with great earnest­ness upon my face and hands. The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right fore­hoof, and dis­com­posed it so much that I was forced to ad­just it bet­ter by tak­ing it off, and set­tling it again; whereat both he and his com­pan­ion (who was a brown bay) ap­peared to be much sur­prised; the lat­ter felt the lap­pet of my coat, and find­ing it to hang loose about me, they both looked with new signs of won­der. He stroked my right hand, seem­ing to ad­mire the soft­ness and color; but he squeezed it so hard be­tween his hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; af­ter which they both touched me with all pos­si­ble ten­der­ness. They were un­der great per­plex­ity about my shoes and stock­ings, which they felt very of­ten, neigh­ing to each other, and us­ing var­i­ous ges­tures, not un­like those of a philoso­pher, when he would at­tempt to solve some new and dif­fi­cult phe­nom­e­non."/>

                <ITEXT CH="Upon the whole, the be­hav­ior of these an­i­mals was so or­derly and ra­tio­nal, so acute and ju­di­cious, that I at last con­cluded they must needs be ma­gi­cians, who had thus meta­mor­phosed them­selves upon some de­sign, and see­ing a stranger in the way, were re­solved to di­vert them­selves with him; or per­haps were re­ally amazed at the sight of a man so very dif­fer­ent in habit, fea­ture, and com­plex­ion, from those who might prob­a­bly live in so re­mote a cli­mate. Upon the strength of this rea­son­ing I ven­tured to ad­dress them in the fol­low­ing man­ner: “Gen­tle­men, if you be con­jurors, as I have good cause to be­lieve, you can un­der­stand any lan­guage; there­fore I make bold to let your wor­ships know that I am a poor dis­tressed En­glish­man, driven by his mis­for­tunes upon your coast; and I en­treat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if he were a real horse, to some house or vil­lage where I can be re­lieved. In re­turn of which fa­vor, I will make you a present of this knife and bracelet” (tak­ing them out of my pocket). The two crea­tures stood silent while I spoke, seem­ing to lis­ten with great at­ten­tion; and when I had ended, they neighed fre­quently to­wards each other, as if they were en­gaged in se­ri­ous con­ver­sa­tion. I plainly ob­served that their lan­guage ex­pressed the pas­sions very well, and the words might, with lit­tle pains, be re­solved into an al­pha­bet more eas­ily than the Chi­nese."/>

I now be­gan to be a lit­tle com­forted, and took out some toys which trav­el­ers usu­ally carry for presents to the sav­age In­di­ans of Amer­ica and other parts, in hopes the peo­ple of the house would be thereby en­cour­aged to re­ceive me kindly. The horse made me a sign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a rack and manger ex­tend­ing the whole length on one side. There were three nags and two mares, not eat­ing, but some of them sit­ting down upon their hams, which I very much won­dered at; but won­dered more to see the rest em­ployed in do­mes­tic busi­ness. They seemed but or­di­nary cat­tle; how­ever, this con­firmed my first opin­ion, that a peo­ple who could so far civ­i­lize brute an­i­mals must needs ex­cel in wis­dom all the na­tions of the world. The gray came in just af­ter, and thereby pre­vented any ill treat­ment which the oth­ers might have given me. He neighed to them sev­eral times in a style of au­thor­ity, and re­ceived an­swers."/>

Here the gray walked in first, beck­on­ing me to at­tend; I waited in the sec­ond room, and got ready my presents for the mas­ter and mis­tress of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearl, a small look­ing-glass, and a bead neck­lace. The horse neighed three or four times, and I waited to hear some an­swers in a hu­man voice, but I heard no other re­turns than in the same di­alect, only one or two a lit­tle shriller than his. I be­gan to think that this house must be­long to some per­son of great note among them, be­cause there ap­peared so much cer­e­mony be­fore I could gain ad­mit­tance. But, that a man of qual­ity should be served all by horses was be­yond my com­pre­hen­sion. I feared my brain was dis­turbed by my suf­fer­ings and mis­for­tunes: I roused my­self, and looked about me in the room where I was left alone; this was fur­nished like the first, only af­ter a more el­e­gant man­ner. I rubbed my eyes of­ten, but the same ob­jects still oc­curred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake my­self, hop­ing I might be in a dream. I then ab­so­lutely con­cluded that all these ap­pear­ances could be noth­ing else but necro­mancy and magic. But I had no time to pur­sue these re­flec­tions; for the gray horse came to the door, and made me a sign to fol­low him into the third room, where I saw a very comely mare, to­gether with a colt and foal, sit­ting on their haunches upon mats of straw, not unart­fully made and per­fectly neat and clean."/>

This la­bor took up sev­eral days’ con­ver­sa­tion be­fore he was able to com­pre­hend me. He was wholly at a loss to know what could be the use or ne­ces­sity of prac­tic­ing those vices. To clear up which I en­deav­ored to give him some idea of the de­sire of power and riches; of the ter­ri­ble ef­fects of lust, in­tem­per­ance, mal­ice, and envy. All this I was forced to de­fine and de­scribe by putting of cases and mak­ing of sup­po­si­tions. Af­ter which, like one whose imag­i­na­tion was struck with some­thing never seen or heard of be­fore, he would lift up his eyes with amaze­ment and in­dig­na­tion. Power, gov­ern­ment, war, law, pun­ish­ment, and a thou­sand other things had no terms wherein that lan­guage could ex­press them; which made the dif­fi­culty al­most in­su­per­a­ble to give my mas­ter any con­cep­tion of what I meant. But, be­ing of an ex­cel­lent un­der­stand­ing, much im­proved by con­tem­pla­tion and con­verse, he at last ar­rived at a com­pe­tent knowl­edge of what hu­man na­ture, in our parts of the world, is ca­pa­ble to per­form, and de­sired I would give him some par­tic­u­lar ac­count of that land which we call Eu­rope, but es­pe­cially of my own coun­try."/>

Dif­fer­ence in opin­ions has cost many mil­lions of lives: for in­stance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the juice of a cer­tain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or virtue; whether it be bet­ter to kiss a post or throw it into the fire; what is the best color for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray, and whether it should be long or short, nar­row or wide, dirty or clean, with many more.

Some­times one prince quar­rels with an­other, for fear the other should quar­rel with him. Some­times a war is en­tered upon, be­cause the en­emy is too strong, and some­times be­cause he is too weak. Some­times our neigh­bors want the things which we have, or have the things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us theirs. It is a very jus­ti­fi­able cause of war to in­vade a coun­try af­ter the peo­ple have been wasted by famine, de­stroyed by pesti­lence, or em­broiled by fac­tions among them­selves. It is jus­ti­fi­able to en­ter into war against our near­est ally, when one of his towns lies con­ve­nient for us, or a ter­ri­tory of land that would ren­der our do­min­ions round and com­plete. If a prince sends forces into a na­tion where the peo­ple are poor and ig­no­rant, he may law­fully put half of them to death, and make slaves of the rest, in or­der to civ­i­lize and re­duce them from their bar­barous way of liv­ing. It is a very kingly, hon­or­able, and fre­quent prac­tice, when one prince de­sires the as­sis­tance of an­other to se­cure him against an in­va­sion, that the as­sis­tant, when he has driven out the in­vader, should seize on the do­min­ions him­self, and kill, im­prison, or ban­ish the prince he came to re­lieve. Al­liance by blood or mar­riage, is a fre­quent cause of war be­tween princes; and the nearer the kin­dred is, the greater is their dis­po­si­tion to quar­rel. Poor na­tions are hun­gry, and rich na­tions are proud, and pride and hunger will ever be at vari­ance.

The re­sult was that it was found need­ful to sup­ply that by ar­ti­fice and cun­ning which could not be pro­cured by just and hon­est meth­ods; the bet­ter to bring which about, there was among us a so­ci­ety of men bred from their youth in the art of prov­ing, by words mul­ti­plied for the pur­pose, that white is black, and black is white, ac­cord­ing as they are paid. The great­ness of the as­sur­ance of these men, and the bold­ness of their pre­ten­sions, gained the ad­her­ence of the mass of the peo­ple, of whom in a man­ner they made slaves, and got into their hands much the largest share of the prac­tice of their pro­fes­sion. These prac­ti­tion­ers were by men of dis­cern­ment called pet­ti­fog­gers (that is, con­founders, or rather, de­stroy­ers of right), and it was my ill luck as well as the mis­for­tune of my ac­quain­tances, to have been at the mercy of this species of the pro­fes­sion.

                <ITEXT CH="I will sup­pose that my neigh­bor has a mind to my cow; he hires one of these ad­vo­cates to prove that he ought to have my cow from me. I must then hire an­other to de­fend my right, it be­ing against all rules of law that any man shall be al­lowed to speak for him­self. Now, in this case, I who am the right owner, lie un­der two great dis­ad­van­tages. First, my ad­vo­cate, be­ing prac­ticed al­most from the cra­dle in de­fend­ing false­hood, is quite out of his el­e­ment when he would ar­gue for right, which, be­ing un­nat­u­ral to him, he at­tempts with great awk­ward­ness, if not with ill will. The sec­ond dis­ad­van­tage is that my ad­vo­cate must pro­ceed with great cau­tion, for since the main­te­nance of so many de­pends on the prac­tice of law not be­ing less­ened by too sum­mary pro­ceed­ings, even should he fail to in­cur the dis­plea­sure of the judges he is sure to gain the ill will and ha­tred of his brethren. This be­ing the case, I have but two meth­ods to pre­serve my cow. The first is to gain over my ad­ver­sary’s ad­vo­cate with a dou­ble fee, his ed­u­ca­tion be­ing such that it is rea­son­able to ex­pect he can be in­duced to be­tray his client and let the bal­ance fall on my side. The sec­ond way is for my ad­vo­cate to re­frain from in­sist­ing on the jus­tice of my cause, by al­low­ing the cow to be­long to my ad­ver­sary; and this, if it be skill­fully done, will go a long way to­ward ob­tain­ing a fa­vor­able ver­dict, it hav­ing been found by care­ful ob­ser­va­tion of is­sues and events, that un­der the man­age­ment of such prac­ti­tion­ers, the wrong side has the fairer chance of suc­cess, more es­pe­cially if it should hap­pen, as it did in my own and my friend’s case, that the per­son ap­pointed to de­cide all con­tro­ver­sies con­cern­ing prop­erty as well as to try crim­i­nals, who should be cho­sen from among the most learned and wise of his pro­fes­sion, is by the rec­om­men­da­tion of a great fa­vorite or court mis­tress taken from the sect be­fore men­tioned, and so hav­ing been strongly bi­ased all his life against eq­uity and fair deal­ing, lies, as it were, un­der a fa­tal ne­ces­sity of fa­vor­ing, dou­ble deal­ing and op­pres­sion, and be­sides, through age, in­fir­mity, and dis­tem­per hav­ing be­come lazy and inat­ten­tive, he is al­most in­ca­pac­i­tated from do­ing any­thing be­com­ing the duty of his of­fice. The de­ci­sions of men so bred and qual­i­fied may with rea­son be ex­pected to be on the wrong side of the cause, for it is lit­tle won­der that those who can take ha­rangue and noise (if pur­sued with warmth and drawn out to great length) for rea­son­ing, will in­fer the weight of the ar­gu­ment from the heav­i­ness of the plead­ing."/>

But his honor was still to seek; for he went upon a sup­po­si­tion that all an­i­mals had a ti­tle to their share in the pro­duc­tions of the earth, and es­pe­cially those who presided over the rest. There­fore he de­sired I would let him know what these costly meats were, and how any of us hap­pened to want them. Where­upon I enu­mer­ated as many sorts as came into my head, with the var­i­ous meth­ods of dress­ing them, which could not be done with­out send­ing ves­sels by sea to ev­ery part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces, and in­nu­mer­able other con­ve­nien­cies.

But what he chiefly won­dered at was how such vast tracts of ground as I de­scribed should be wholly with­out fresh wa­ter, and the peo­ple put to the ne­ces­sity of send­ing over the sea for drink. I replied that Eng­land (the dear place of my na­tiv­ity) was com­puted to pro­duce three times the quan­tity of food more than its in­hab­i­tants are able to con­sume, as well as liquors ex­tracted from grain, or pressed out of the fruit of cer­tain trees, which made ex­cel­lent drink; and the same pro­por­tion in ev­ery other con­ve­nience of life. But, in or­der to feed the lux­ury and in­tem­per­ance of the males, and the van­ity of the fe­males, we sent away the great­est part of our nec­es­sary things to other coun­tries, whence in re­turn we brought the ma­te­ri­als of dis­eases, folly, and vice, to spend among our­selves. Hence it fol­lows of ne­ces­sity, that vast num­bers of our peo­ple are com­pelled to seek their liveli­hood by beg­ging, rob­bing, steal­ing, cheat­ing, flat­ter­ing, sub­orn­ing, for­swear­ing, forg­ing, gam­ing, ly­ing, fawn­ing, hec­tor­ing, vot­ing, scrib­bling, star-gaz­ing, poi­son­ing, cant­ing, li­bel­ing, free-think­ing, and the like oc­cu­pa­tions; ev­ery one of which terms I was at much pains to make him un­der­stand."/>

How­ever, I did then be­lieve us to be about 10 de­grees south­ward of the Cape of Good Hope, or about 45 de­grees south­ern lat­i­tude, as I gath­ered from some gen­eral words I over­heard among them, be­ing, I sup­posed, to the south­east in their in­tended voy­age to Mada­gas­car.

The wind was full west, and by six in the evening I com­puted I had gone east­ward at least eigh­teen leagues; when I spied a very small is­land about half a league off, which I soon reached. It was noth­ing but a rock, with one creek nat­u­rally arched by the force of tem­pests. Here I put in my ca­noe, and climb­ing a part of the rock, I could plainly dis­cover land to the east ex­tend­ing from south to north. I lay all night in my ca­noe, and re­peat­ing my voy­age early in the morn­ing, I ar­rived in seven hours to the south­west point of New Hol­land.

I con­jured him to con­ceal from all per­sons what I had told him of the Houy­hnhnms; be­cause the least hint of such a story would not only draw num­bers of peo­ple to see me, but prob­a­bly put me in dan­ger of be­ing im­pris­oned, or burnt by the In­qui­si­tion. The cap­tain per­suaded me to ac­cept a suit of clothes newly made, but I would not suf­fer the tai­lor to take my mea­sure; how­ever, Don Pe­dro be­ing al­most of my size, they fit­ted me well enough.

Be­fore his birth his fa­ther died, and his youth was em­bit­tered by the grudg­ing pro­vi­sion made by an un­cle for his ed­u­ca­tion. Though a keen lover of his­tory and po­etry, he held in high dis­dain the or­di­nary study rou­tine and the var­i­ous reg­u­la­tions which gov­ern in­sti­tu­tions, ob­tain­ing his de­gree from Trin­ity Col­lege in Ire­land’s cap­i­tal city only by grace of spe­cial in­dul­gence."/>

Its covert ridicule of rulers, courts, states­men, and po­lit­i­cal or­ga­ni­za­tions was so se­vere and cut so ruth­lessly and cru­elly deep, that only its di­a­bol­i­cal clev­er­ness pre­vented its sup­pres­sion and in­stead lent it an un­prece­dented pop­u­lar­ity.
