# Typesetting experiment

This repository contains the book [Gulliver's
Travels](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/65473) typeset with
LibreOffice and Scribus using the same options. The PDF output of both
is also provided. For more info see [blog post
one](https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2021/06/formatting-entire-book-with-libreoffice.html)
and [blog post
two](https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2021/06/typesetting-full-book-part-ii-scribus.html).

The Scribus PDF is exported with outlined fonts, because using
embedded fonts triggered a bug in Evince.

The original book is in the public domain and comes from Project
Gutenberg. The typeset versions are free for personal use.
