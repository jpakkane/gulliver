# Typesetting experiment

This repository contains the book [Gulliver's
Travels](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/65473) typeset with
LibreOffice and Scribus using the same options. The PDF output of both
is also provided.

The Scribus PDF is exported with outlined fonts, because using
embedded fonts triggered a bug in Evince.

The original book is in the public domain and comes from Project
Gutenberg. The typeset versions are free for personal use.
